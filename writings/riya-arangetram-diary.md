#### June 26th, 2025

Wrap up work by 12 noon and start for Bay Area at 2 after Kathal and veggie biryani lunch made by the famous chef Kamini. George and Alu kutti have tagged along inside a bag. Aunty is taking a work call. Someone has to be fired tomorrow. Lots of truck cowboys overtaking with scant notice are annoying me. From their perspective it makes sense though, since their earnings depend on minimizing travel time. It's hot and have to turn off AC on hills while ascending. There is smoke from a fire in the distance. Listen to New Hindi songs and African playlist on the way. Drive straight through with no halts and reach Sunnyvale at 7:30. Dinner at Komala Vilas since Vidya and Riya are at stage rehearsal till 10 and don't want to bother them. Shonu has sambar vadai and we have masala dosa topped off with filter kapi. *Beshu naanam*. 

Reach Hari house by 8:30. He has arranged for us to occupy his ADU which is a studio with kitchenette and bathroom in the basement level. Hari and Mimi greet us. Mimi is giving off ultra friendly vibes. Not the slightest hint of aggression. Even Aunty ji isn't perturbed in the slightest. Hari brings a bed cover for the air mattress which we struggle mightily with fitting before realizing that it is the wrong size. Another cover does fit. We retire for the night. Hari has some India calls to take.

Aunty wakes up at 7:45 and gets ready. She has to give bad news to a subordinate. Shonu also gets ready. I wake up a little later and make coffee in Keurig. It is strong. Shonu has heated Starbucks mocha and Aunty has Starbucks espresso and cream. Get ready while Aunty is giving bad news to some poor fellow. Go up to the house for breakfast at 9ish after getting ready. Have paratha and poha with chai. Venu Chithappa and Raju chithi arrive after some time. 

Kamini has to meet someone from Shopify at 10:30 in San Mateo at a Paris Baguette. It's a 15 min drive. I drop her, we park in a garage and me and Shonu sit in the baguette shop at another table. We get some vegan pastries while we wait. Shonu gets a peach iced tea. Pastries are decent though falling short of great. Back at Hari's house by 12, we run into Datta, Sushma and Datta's son Aryan. Datta is gregarious and  disarming and it doesn't feel like we are meeting him for the first time. Riya has also made a rare appearance. Vidya has tasks for everyone. Shonu is writing dinner directions on a chalk board. I leave for my lunch appointment with Mahesh Patil in Palo Alto at 12:30. I'm late by 15 mins. 

Park in public parking near University ave and walk to meet him. He's in a half sleeve shirt and pants. I call to locate him and he waves and tells me – "Yes, I'm that handsome man". He looks the same except for a little thinner hair which is a problem most people have at our age. 

We initially stop at a Chinese restaurant but their vegan selection is limited so we walk to Khazana which is Sanjeev Kapoor's restaurant. Nice ambience. We sit at a table next to the street. Has a European feel. We order a couple of small plates to share – a spiced paneer cube item with side salad and a mushroom and pepper curry with a side of paratha slices. Both items are richly flavored and nicely textured. For main course, we order a large plate of cauliflower in a thick gravy with rice and naan. This has a unique taste, mildly spicy with soft pieces of either baked or fried cauliflower in a cashew based gravy that is savory not sweet – a welcome change from the run of the mill Punjabi stuff that Indian restaurants in the US flog to death. 

Discussion jumps around to many topics. My trip to India, Shonu's music classes in Nashik, Ratlam – one of his friends is from there – and sev! I ask him about his travel plans. He visited India in March. His father aged 85 passed away. He was suffering from Parkinson's and had memory issues. I offer my condolences. His mom is with him. His parents have been living in Sangli district for many years. His mom has a good support system there and it is more pollution free than Mumbai. His wife wants to go back to India but he is concerned by the bureaucracy, KYC spamming from banks and air quality issues in Mumbai. 

He is working at his own startup. They are small – 5 people – but self sustaining. He doesn't want to go to VCs and be hostage to their agendas. He is happy working on his own ideas and says he can't go back to being an employee. 

His son is studying computer science at Purdue. I ask him about prospects for entry level jobs. He agrees it is difficult to enter the field. However senior engineers who can leverage AI will do alright. What happens when they retire and no juniors have been hired for a while? Maybe they have to join startups where energy is more important than grizzled expertise. 

His daughter Anisha is entering 10th grade. She is into sports – track and field. Tell him about Shonu and hockey. 

On the way back, pick up posters at a print shop ARC document solutions in an industrial backlot. An Asian woman can't find the order but an Indian – who is actually a Sri Lankan Tamil named Antony – knows right away and hands me the package. I ask him to open it so that I can check. All is well and I pay him $63. He says he discounted it heavily from $300. 

Back at Hari's house, setup  Starlink for live streaming since venue has no WiFi and poor cell signal. Have to experiment with antenna placement and finally get it to work by walking up the stairs in the steeply sloped backyard. Have to create an account for roaming plan since Vidya's boss, who has kindly shared his credentials, is traveling and not available for the OTP. 

Family gathering at Vidya's family's Airbnb. Vidya's sister Sushma and her husband Datta, their son Aryan who studied industrial and systems engineering because dad studied engineering (mechanical at VJTI 92 batch) but is now working in finance as an intern in Philadelphia. Sushma who lives in Atlanta, was with Deloitte and works in IT. Sushil, Vidya's brother is there. His family is not there since his father in law in India isn't keeping well. He shares same birthday as me. His son Daksh is aged 12 going into 7th grade. He is working in Nashville in AO Smith as a SAP architect. He worked at Apple previously on Vision Pro back office. Usha Mami, Rasika and Radhika arrive later. Poor Rasika can barely talk after her surgery but can't restrain herself and ends up doing a lot of talking. Mamaji has misplaced his glasses and is going back to his office to get them so won't come today. We remind them of the infamous forgotten glasses incident. Hari, Mamaji and us were on our way back from SFO Pier 39 and a good way home when Hari remembered that he had forgotten his glasses in some store. He made Mamaji grumblingly turn around and go all the way back. To his vexation, the glasses weren't at the store. They turned out to have been in his jacket pocket all along! Raju chithi and Venu Chithappa are there too. 

Aunty is asked to sing and delegates to Shonu who is grumblingly forced into singing an abhang. She sings *Bolava vithala* and is complemented by Vidya's family on her flawless Marathi pronunciation. 

Ram and Jaya show up later. Jaya is Appa's cousin from his mother's side. Hari is close to them, but I don't sense any connection.

Call Appa and chat for some time. Tell him to watch the live stream.

Riya arangetram at 3 today. I am first to wake up and get ready. Make coffee and mix it with Starbucks mocha. Less bitter. Datta, Sushil and Sebastian, who Datta informs us is Nidhi's partner, bring down some food to keep in the ADU fridge. Go upstairs. Datta and Sushil are there having breakfast. Datta's daughter Nidhi is there and says hi. Sushma is also there. Breakfast is idli sambar and chutney. Idli is soft and sambar and chutneys are thick and nicely spiced. Food is from a place called Tabla. Sit outside with Sushil at a round table with chai and sambar. We discuss each other's work. Apparently SAP can be deployed on premises and in cloud. The latter is much cheaper but companies are reluctant to let go their on prem assets who have vast business knowledge. It has a programming language called ABAP and uses Oracle as the database. The service cost is mainly for data storage. 

We are joined by Datta, Sushma, Kamini, Shonu and Nidhi. Nidhi is a medical intern in Chula Vista. She is an obstetrician and has delivered 40 odd babies! So well mannered and unassuming. She speaks perfect Spanish to boot. Her mother says she appears more Mexican than Indian.

Sushma offers us a tax tip of starting an LLC, paying ourselves a small salary as employees and the remainder as profits to the LLC on which we have to pay lower corporate taxes. Apparently this idea was given to her by a Marwari friend. Hard to top a Marwari when it comes to money, but apparently Jews are a level higher according to her.

We head to the venue, Hillsdale High School with Hari at 11. We enter via a back entrance. I setup Starlink and manage to get it working after fiddling with the location. We all help with decorations. The video guy, a desi, says he isn't getting sufficient bandwidth for upload. I seem to be getting 10+Mbps upload on WiFi. Nevertheless, move the antenna to a more open area on the grass. Still the guy is not happy. He says he will use a patch cable instead of WiFi. Sure. Help move the WiFi router closer to where he is so that he can cable into it. 

We're unsure whether lunch is nut free so go to a nearby Taco Bell on El Camino Real and have a Mexican pizza each. Might be the same one I frequented when I first arrived in the Bay Area in 2000 and was living in a Howard Johnson nearby. Then we go back to ADU to get dressed. 

Back at the theater, the front rows have been reserved for family except the 1st row which is left empty to minimize distractions. We sit in the second row next to Raju chithi. Venu Chithappa is sitting at the back in a solitary chair. Mamaji and family are sitting behind us. Hari gives an extempore speech paying tribute to both mothers who are not with us and tells a story about Riya's birth. She was apparently not moving for 2 hours and docs told him to go for c-section and to expect the worst. She was born fine. Apparently she was sleeping and yawned and went right back to sleep. Vidya had a written speech. She too paid tribute to the departed mothers and was sorry that Appa couldn't be here but hoped he was watching the livestream. 

Then the guru - Kanchana Venkat - spoke. Either she was nervous for her student or she wasn't a natural public speaker. She introduced the accompanying musicians who included a singer, a violinist and a mridangam player. All senior artists. 

The performance started shortly. Riya was very graceful and clearly a lot of effort had gone into her dress and makeup. The music was quite good. She started with Pushpanjali, an offering to the departed mothers, guru and musicians. There were a couple of more pieces of which the Varnam was longest at 35 mins. It was a more technical piece and she did very well.  

At the midway interval, chai and snacks – samosa and mysore paku – were served. There was also mango lassi which these two had while I had chai. Thomas introduced himself and said that he remembered me from a housewarming for Hari's previous house a decade ago. Great memory since I didn't recognize him at all. Exchanged pleasantries. Usha mami's brother and sister were here and said hi. Aunty did marketing for Shonu to Rajan. His wife also apparently is a Hindustani singer. I had messaged and called Appa prior to the function and he called me back to say that he was awake and watching the live stream. Informed Hari who was happy. 

In the second half Riya looked even more relaxed and assured. There were pieces for Rama, Durga and Krishna where she excelled not only with the movements but also the facial expressions. The Arangetram was over by 6 and there was generous applause. It was the culmination of more than a decade of hard work. She clearly has a talent for dance and could make a career in it if she chooses. 

Dinner followed at the adjacent cafeteria. It was North Indian fare – tikki Chana, paneer, naan, rice, payassam. Fairly good. We sat with Raju chithi and Venu Chithappa. 

Posed for some family photos. Prashant, Vidya's cousin, took us aside and asked us to inform our family about a surprise celebration for Hari's 50th birthday. I was asked to take Hari out for 10 minutes so they could setup. I made up something about giving him the Starlink box. When he went back in, he was caught off guard by the surprise. There was a cake cutting and he sang some Arijit number which I hadn't heard - apparently his first song. 

Usha Mami asked us to come to her house. We had to drop Raju chithi and Venu Chithappa to their hotel on the way in Redwood Shores, near the Oracle complex. They asked us to pick up their laundry from Mamaji's house. 

It was a longer drive than anticipated. When we arrive, the garage door is open and Kamini urges us to go through the open garage door entrance. Shonu comments that it isn't a very normal way of entering someone's house. At Mamaji's house, Usha Mami was pleasantly surprised to see us. She thought we weren't coming. We sat in the remodeled backyard which was nice. Mamaji was hanging laundry to dry. Apparently Venu Chithappa spilled something on his jacket and Usha Mami offered to launder it, and since they were going to do a wash, more laundry was added. Some cricket chit chat ensued. A bee attack forced Shonu indoors. 

Talk turned to Shonu, AOPS, Math classes, mock trial, University etc. Radhika also came down later though she was feeling down. The missing laundry was located after a search. We finally bid goodbye at around 10:15 and drove back. 

#### June 29th, 2025

Drive back after saying bye to Hari and Vidya and having idli and chai. Hari calls Appa on video and we have a nice chat about yesterday's event. Shonu recounts the "unkil" incident. While negotiating with a *raddiwala*, the guy tells Appa "*Unkil aapne baniyan ulta pehena hai*" which totally throws Appa off from the negotiation. I ask about Mimi and am told she was with a dog minder since she could'nt handle seeing too many people. We pack some Indian Chinese leftovers. I am glad we were able to say bye to Hari and Vidya. Start at 9:15 reach at 3. Drive back is faster. Less truck cowboys. Halt at Tejon for Taco Bell and refuel. Hit some traffic as we enter LA. Par for the course. 

Shower and take a nice nap. 

Have chai and later the Indian Chinese food for dinner. 

Shonu and Aunty have a disagreement.

Call and chat for a while with Appa, recounting the trip.
