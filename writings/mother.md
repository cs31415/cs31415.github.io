### Mother

O Mother, you who carry mankind in your womb<br/>
Showering upon it all your infinite love<br/>
When alive and from deep within the tomb<br/>
Your gentle caresses soothe our furrowed brow<br/>

O Creator and nurturer of civilization<br/>
What would the world be without your warmth<br/>
But a place of quiet desperation<br/>
Yearning for your shadow by the hearth<br/>

O Mother, You are the eternal tree<br/>
Where flowers unfold and bloom<br/>
You are the fragrance that lingers<br/>
Long after it has left the room<br/>
