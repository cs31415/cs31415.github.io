### Ramu Somu and the Great Cricket match

It was a picture perfect summer morning, in conditions as close to English weather as could be possible in derelict, dusty Shivajinagar. A day tailormade for cricket, cricketer and photographer's dream simultaneously come true. Fluffy cotton white clouds against deep azure blue skies and a sea of lush dew-soaked bright green carpeting the earth within the ramshackle confines of Nehru Stadium. 

Ramu and Somu were looking forward to this great day with as much anticipation as a bride looking forward to her wedding. It was the final of the Shivajinagar inter-school cricket tournament. Their school, Veermata Jijabai High School a.k.a. VJHS (formerly Victoria Jubilee High School, renamed since by politicians to distract from more pressing issues, to the consternation of alumni who felt relegated to provincial status), were up against their arch rivals from Morarji High School (popularly known as "morons"). Duffers. Good for nothing but cricket. Had just happened to pound VJHS to a pulp on every occasion in living memory. The mortification had grown too much to bear for Ramu Somu, yet it kept growing year after year, with not a glimmer of hope on the horizon.

Pundits, soothsayers and punters were unanimous in their odds for a VJHS victory - one in a trillion. Numbers beyond Ramu Somu's meager comprehension; yet they instinctively knew that the probability of Shivajinagar's gutters not overflowing in the monsoon was far greater than their chances of wrapping their sorry fingers around the coveted trophy.

All this while, a diabolical idea had been taking shape in Ramu's head. He confided his masterstroke to Somu, not so much for a second opinion as to inform him about the role he would play in it. Ramu was used to dispensing orders, Somu to their unquestioning execution. Qamar and Amar were the star fast bowlers for the "morons", frighteningly quick and able to swing the ball late, provincial clones of Wasim and Waqar, a partnership that struck terror in adolescent hearts full of innocence. Qamar the left-arm fast bowler, cunning as a fox. Amar the right-arm version, swinging the ball like a boomerang at high pace, notorious for fracturing many a callow arm, leg and rib, with not even the cursory inquiry as to the victim's wellbeing. Seldom did he bowl in a game where leather didn't thud into reinforced plastic with a crack that echoed around empty stands (and empty heads too, according to some uncharitable observers).

So unplayable had they become that foul tactics were often suspected by opposition teams – ball tampering, performance enhancing drugs, age restriction infringements, etc. This was usually just an exercise in vindicating their own mediocrity.

Ramu's plan was ingenious as well as insidious. He had made Somu befriend the drinks boy for the morons, Bhola. Bhola had a longstanding grievance against Qamar and Amar. They treated him like a personal servant, forcing him to do menial chores – ferrying their laundry to and from the dry cleaners, getting *vada pav* and *chai* for them every hour, carrying their kits, cleaning chairs for them before they graced them, and so on. Resentment had been simmering and was not far from boiling point. Bhola, though he was the drinks boy, harbored fond hopes of one day playing in the main eleven. He possessed a legbreak sharper than Cleopatra's nose and a googly more deceptive than a Mumbai pickpocket. Somu didn't have to exert himself; Bhola was a sitting duck. A paper chit containing mysterious powder clandestinely exchanged hands. Bottles containing laxative labels and warnings were discreetly disposed off in dust bins.

On the big game day, the hour of reckoning arrived. VJHS won the toss, and elected to bat. Ramu Somu rubbed their hands in anticipation of the drama that was imminent. They kept sneaking glances at the opposition dugout to see whether Qamar and Amar would take the field. They never did. Their plan had worked after all. Smiles and winks were smugly exchanged. Qamar and Amar were busy with sudden and unexpected business in rest rooms from where loud cries, volleys of curses, and continuous flushing noises were heard by bystanders.

Shyam and Ghanshyam, an off-spinner and wrist-spinner respectively, were selected as replacements for the indisposed quicks. To Ramu Somu's perplexity, the wicket started taking turn from the 1st over. Shyam and Ghanshyam sliced through the VJHS lineup like  a hot knife through butter. VJHS were skittled out for 15 meager runs. A spineless performance that filled Ramu Somu's hearts with a cocktail of shame, rage and bewilderment. The morons knocked off the runs in three balls, each hit for a six, to compound and rub in the humiliation. Ramu Somu could not bear to watch as the morons celebrated wildly, bar two of them who were still busy with unmentionable business.
