### Mahabharata - Some Questions

Questions after reading R.K.Narayan’s retelling of the great Indian epic, the Mahabharata:

1. Why did Vidura not marry?
2. Why did Drona and Bhishma support the Kauravas? Weren’t they aware of the  path of Dharma, learned as they were?
3. Why did Karna befriend Duryodhana? What was his grouse against the Pandavas?
4. Did Arjuna really burn the Khandava Vana roasting alive thousands of innocent animals and birds? What justification could there be for such a heinous act?
5. Why did none of the illustrious Pandavas, Vidura and Bheeshma have an answer to Draupadi’s question about whether Yudhishtira had the right to gamble her away having already lost himself first? Why did Bheeshma provide a highly evasive and sexist answer that a man’s wife was still his property even though he be a slave? Why was it left to Vikarna, a callow young Kaurava to demand that Draupadi’s question be answered and then go on to provide the answer – that she wasn’t won fair and square and ought to be returned? Why was this logical answer ignored by all present?
6. Why should accepting a call to gamble with limitless stakes be considered a Kshatriya’s duty? Isn’t his duty to his kingdom and family greater than to some esoteric code?
7. Why would Yudhishtira repeat the same egregious blunder (of accepting a call to gamble) twice? Was he really that naive or idiotic?
8. Why did the Pandavas think it was alright to kill an innocent woman and her five children when they set fire to the straw, oil and resin house in Varanavata?
9. Chapter 16 says that all hundred sons of Dhritirashtra were slain in the Mahabharat war. Yet later in the same chapter there is mention of Yuyutsu, the lone surviving son of Dhritirashtra who crossed over to the Pandava camp early in the battle. Isn’t this a contradiction?
10. Why was Sanjaya, a mere charioteer, and one who had turned a blind eye to Draupadi’s humiliation at that, and offered unsolicited advice to boot to the Pandavas to remain mendicants rather than kill their kith and kin, chosen by Yudhishtira to look after the finances of the state? What were his qualifications, if any, for the job?
11. If Bhishma was a “storehouse of knowledge of the world, kingship, and human conduct” and worthy of passing on instruction to Yudhishtira as he lay dying on a bed of arrows, then why did he support the evil-incarnate, Duryodhana, and fight on his behalf? And why didn’t he prevent Draupadi’s humiliation at the hands of the Kauravas?
12. Why did Duryodhana and Karna and Dussasana, despite having lived lives of unremitting evil, still go to heaven when slain in battle? Just because they were killed in battle? Doesn’t this sound suspiciously like the Islamic ideal of martyr’s heaven?
13. If Karna was really Arjuna’s equal, then why was he “mauled by Arjuna and made to withdraw in a bloody state”, in the prequel to the Great War in Virata?
14. Why did Parasurama rather than praising Karna’s devotion to him in ignoring a painful bug bite that his Guru might not be disturbed, instead punish him with a terrible curse for lying to him about being a Brahmin, that ultimately was to result in Karna’s death? Wasn’t this sheer cussedness, ingratitude and inability to rein in anger on the “great” Parasurama’s part?
15. Why did Bheeshma, Drona and Vidura, despite being aware of the path of Dharma, never consider crossing over to the Pandava camp? Vidura did try once when the Pandavas were in exile, but retreated pusillanimously when summoned back by Dhritirashtra. Why? What was the Kauravas’ hold over these illustrious men that they were willing to abandon the path of Dharma for them? Was it just that they were being supported by them? If so, why didn’t they take steps to curb and eliminate that obligation early on when they started becoming aware of Duryodhana’s evil nature?
