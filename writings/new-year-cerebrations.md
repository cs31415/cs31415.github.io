### New Year Cerebrations

Another New Year eve looms with the concomitant agonizing and racking of brains over the manner and place of celebration. Celebration implies something to celebrate. Celebrating the passage of an arbitrarily chosen unit of time based on an arbitrary calendar (decreed by, of all people, a Pope named Gregory), based on the year of birth of a religious prophet, seems like a fatuous pastime, with about as much intrinsic value as a Nobel prize awarded to Barack Obama, yet there are whole industries dedicated to exploiting this seemingly innocuous collective patting-oneself-on-the-back-for-nothing-while-inebriated penchant of mankind.

What exactly are we celebrating? The recession which the year gone by was mired in, or the one which the coming annus is expected to cover itself in glory with? Maybe it is the wars being waged in distant corners of the earth by all kinds of self-styled warlords and global cops. Maybe it is to honor the innocent children, women and men mindlessly lost to random bombs and mines and bullets, arsenals of a war not of their making, nor choice. Now, now, no need to succumb to such despairing cynicism, you might say. And well have a point, you may. Indeed, I magnanimously grant a concession on that score in the spirit of letting bygones be bygones. Let us then, if we may, turn our focus to the forthcoming 365 axial rotations that we are about to collectively embark upon.

At the outset, I must confess to having a philosophical objection to ringing in a fresh-with-possibilities new year by drowning oneself in spirits, or mindless mirth and games until midnight, followed by more inane antics until the inevitable descent into slumber ensues in varying degrees of poise and control. What an outstandingly innovative way to start a new chapter in one's life, waking up with an infernal hangover or somnolently waking up at noon when 720 precious minutes of the upcoming year have already been ensnared by the tenacious tentacles of time.

No sir, spare me such vacuous celebrations, spare me the charade, I say. Call me old-fashioned, boring, grandfatherly, or any choice epithets you can muster. I would rather catch a good night?s rest, and wake up fresh, rejuvenated and charged up on the first day of the year. Instead of making half a dozen inane resolutions with no intention of being adhered to, I would rather start out the New Year by living out one resolution, thereby setting a good example, a template, if you may, for the rest of the 364 days.

On that grandiose note, I draw the curtains on this year with the fervent hope that the New Year gives you sufficient cause to celebrate, I mean really celebrate, come this time next year.
