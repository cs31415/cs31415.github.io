Are technology and science and capitalism really helping us lead better lives than our ancestors? Wouldn't we all be better off to hit pause and slow down? Return to the villages and the countryside? Renew our ancient spiritual connection to the land? Spend more time with near and extended family and friends? Eat healthy food and breathe clean air? Peacefully coexist with nature rather than steadily encroaching on wild lands? Isn't this runaway vortex of ever accelerating change playing havoc with our physical and emotional wellbeing? What is the end goal? To cultivate every square inch of land on the planet? And then what? To colonize other worlds? Other galaxies?

Yes on slowing down personally if one feels burnt out or dissatisfied with the path one is on. Periodically hitting pause and resetting goals and expectations is a good thing at an individual level. Many individuals and even great leaders have done precisely that. However, short of a nuclear war or pandemic, there is no way to force this at a civilizational level, nor is it required or a good thing. 

A potent brew of science, technology, and capitalism is what feeds, clothes and shelters a global population of 8 billion. Keeps them healthy, entertained, informed and connected. Gives them a sense of purpose. For all the vitriol directed at big oil, big agro and big pharma, modern civilization is unimaginable without them. Renewable energy, organic, local farming and healthy lifestyles and natural remedies are not scalable enough, affordable enough nor reliable and effective in emergency situations for the teeming masses. Healthy lifestyle is no protection against genetic disorders, accidents, communicable diseases and other freak occurrences. 

It is all well for those well off to want to slow things down. Many others though don't have that luxury. Those waiting for kidney or lung transplants, the poor diligently working their way out of poverty, those seeking to educate themselves and their children to rise above mediocrity, those relying on grants from governments, wealthy patrons and corporations for important scientific and medical advancements, social work such as educating the poor, preventing human trafficking, helping addicts recover, feeding the homeless and the mentally ill, funding those with serious medical conditions who can't afford expensive treatments, etc. For them, progress can't happen quickly enough. 

What is the source of funds for these causes? Governments rely on taxes from citizens and corporations. Private citizens rely on corporate jobs for income. Corporations rely on making a profit to generate revenue. Is the profit driven, commercialized corporate culture then really to blame for all our evils if it sustains all our activities? If corporations were to vanish or scale down, if civilization were to grind to a halt, what would happen to all this work, to all these people, and to anyone else with a burning desire to improve their lot, to create, to invent, to rise, to soar? Armchair philosophers and those who make careers of vilifying progress have no real workable answers. Some will just have governments print money and the rich taxed to solve all problems without thinking too deeply about the unintended consequences. 

There is another reason though that progress cannot stop. The indomitable human spirit, which is forever seeking to improve things, to write great literature, to compose magnificent symphonies, to tell dramatic stories, to create glorious art and architecture, to build ever more sophisticated tools, to scale mountains, to sail the oceans, soar through the skies, to set foot on alien worlds. How can one cage it in a bottle? It is an impractical, immoral and even evil thought. 

If our ancestors had thought like this, we would still be living in caves. If we were lucky enough to be born in the first place. Cave dwellers could never have scaled nor sustained a population of 8 billion even in their wildest dreams. 

Ultimately, it is all a fruitless exercise in venting and wishful thinking. We should all instead be grateful for the modern, abundant, technological civilization full of marvels that we are lucky enough to find ourselves in. Yes it has problems. But we are the solution. Provided we all recognize how lucky we are to have won the lottery of life, stay humble and true to our stewardship of this unique jewel of a planet and cooperate and pull in the same direction. We all have a part to play. Each and every one of us. 

> O me! O life! of the questions of these recurring,  
of the endless trains of the faithless,  
of cities filled with the foolish. 
...  
what good amid these, O me, O life?  
*Answer.*  
That you are here — that life exists, and identity,  
that the powerful play goes on, and you may **contribute a verse**.
