### Somu

Somu the simpleton. Somu the paragon of loyalty. Somu who flows into the social fabric like water, sees everything, hears everything, knows everything. Somu the executive branch to Ramu's legislature and judiciary. Somu the eternal unquestioning friend. Somu the sensitive artist with a discerning photographic eye. Somu the consummate diplomat capable of brokering deals with the unlikeliest bedfellows. Somu the compassionate comforter when schemes go horribly wrong. Somu the raucous reveler when schemes come off exactly as planned. Somu the meticulously methodical planner no detail ever dared escaped from.
