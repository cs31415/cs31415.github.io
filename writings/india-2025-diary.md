### India 2025 Diary


#### June 30, 2025

Wake up at 7:30. Kamini has work calls till 2. Run through laundry list of tasks – watering plants, setting up a drip irrigation for tulsi using plastic water bottle, sprinkler daily setup, packing chappals and weighing bags, repacking hand luggage, making parathas for Shonu to carry, washing hair, getting Shonu to make pasta etc. 

Bathe and get ready. Have lunch at 1:15. Message Pavan asking if he is coming. He had forgotten it was today but says he will come. 

Set out at 2:30 in his Tesla. It is a very smooth ride. Alu kutti and Kiki have tagged along. Recount the trip to Bay Area. Inquire about his parents. He has done health checkups for them. He plans on visiting Ujjain, Indore and surrounding areas for pilgrimage with his parents. Asks Kamini for help with transport and lodging. Discussion turns to Go Lok and how it is connected to earth at an angle of 23 degrees which is why all avatars were born in India. His father who did a PhD in solid state physics was motivated to research these esoteric areas using scientific methods after he became a scientist. I wonder how scientific epistemology, causality and such theories can coexist without cognitive dissonance in the mind of a scientist. Even Nobel winning scientists aren't immune.

Clear security and go to Star Alliance business lounge since we have business class tickets which we got a great deal on. We get some fruit and cheese and cold drinks. Shonu gets chips and pretzels. Plus one for allergen info being clearly marked. Not many vegan options in hot food and none in desserts other than fruit. 

Shonu and Aunty resolve a lingering disagreement and all is well now.

The WiFi login requires a feedback survey and I don't hold back on vegan options or the lack thereof. Shonu fills my water bottle and I don't close it properly. Murphy's Law strikes again and I have to remove laptops and iPads and cameras and passport wallets and use the hand dryer in the restroom for a good 20 minutes (Aunty suggestion) to dry my backpack. By then it is time to board and we hasten to gate 148 for Swiss LX41. There is a surprisingly long line for business class but we are early so in the middle of it rather than at the end. 

Our seats are 7G,J,K. Aunty and Shonu are by the window, mine is an aisle. A couple of school girls in matching red hoodies are traveling solo and one of them asks me if I will switch seats so she can be with her friend who is sitting next to me. Sure. I get seat 8K which is a throne like single window seat. An unexpected gift. 

I am not used to traveling in business class and struggle with the controls. The seat lays flat which is the biggest benefit. The food is also better and is served in plates and bowls with silverware, the drinks in glass flutes. A pink welcome drink is offered. 

I am not sure where to stow my backpack since the cubbyhole in front is hard to reach and doesn't seem secure. I stow it there anyway. The seatbelt is like a car's rather than a lap belt. There are noise reducing headphones which aren't terribly effective. The screen is larger though further away and requires me to stretch to reach it. There is a remote but it isn't convenient to always use it. Aunty is more used to all this. Shonu is enjoying it. It is hard to see them without getting up and leaning over.  

The aircraft is new, spotless and very well maintained. The crew is also very friendly. The backpack pops out during takeoff and I have to hold it under my legs. 

Dinner is served late around 9. A basic salad, hummus and veggies and an asparagus and quinoa salad with ripe orange and grapefruit toppings. Everything is tasty though cold. Concerning. I don't realize then that this is just the first course. It takes a long time for the second course to arrive due to some issue with one of the ovens. It is a daal chawal with some squash curry. Mildly spiced but good. They are not sure if it is nut free so poor Shonu can't have it. She has the hummus and veggies and a packed paratha. Aunty's food is cold so she dismisses it. They offer a dessert of fresh cut fruits which is nice, and Lindor chocolate balls. A different experience overall barring the delay although I prefer the one shot special lunch we get in economy just because it comes quicker and has everything. 

Start watching movie Kaagaz 2 about an army cadet who drops out and reunites with his estranged father who seems to be an activist lawyer who has cancer and faces threats from political goons. Hard to discern the theme of this movie so far. It has veered abruptly from one thread to another. 

Writing Bay Area and this travelogue – an example of self reference. Read a little Godel Escher Bach on my phone which Rajan mama had recommended to Shonu as an illustration of how complexity emerges from simplicity. 

Then recline the seat and take a nice long nap for 6 hours. This is the best feature of flying business. Am able to sleep very well and feel well rested even though it is a 10 hour flight. 

#### July 1, 2025

<span class="credit">Zurich</span>

Landing in Zurich is smooth. The sweeping alpine topography is breathtaking as we approach the airport. The flight has been very efficient and precise like a Swiss watch. 

We head to the Swiss business lounge but are told that it is only accessible on the day of the flight, i.e. tomorrow. Blow. We trudge to the Transit hotel using the train and are welcomed by a kind old lady at the desk. There we learn that bathrooms and showers are not in the room but there are at least common facilities that are just outside the room. There don't seem to be too many people so it's not too bad. In fact it is better than a hotel room since we can all get ready at the same time. The room is spacious and clean with a double bed and one single bed. The bathroom and showers are spic and span. This country is like a neverending advertisement for a cleaning business. 

We all shower and freshen up. Aunty has some office calls to take. Shonu is watching some Spider-Man movie on iPad. 

We have the parathas we packed for dinner – one each with paneer filling – and retire for the night. 

#### July 2, 2025

Wake up at 2 and can't sleep. Think about number theory. Ordinal numbers which indicate position and are what humans learned first using fingers and toes to count, cardinal numbers which represent quantities, natural numbers (*1,2,3...*), whole numbers (*0,1,2,3...*), integers (*...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...*), real numbers (lie on the number line), imaginary numbers (orthogonal to number line), complex numbers (mixture of real and imaginary), rational (of the form *m/n* where *m* and *n* are integers and *n≠0*), irrational numbers (not of the above form). Irrational numbers are chaotic in the sense that they can't be pinned down on the number line however much you magnify them. They are dancing around at smaller scales and never quite converging. Yet out of all this chaos there is emergent order on the surface level. The circle is orderly as is science and engineering which rely heavily on irrational numbers. Just like the emergent order of the macroscopic universe despite the unending chaos that roils the subatomic world just beneath the surface.

*The Irrational Gene* could be a book title. How those who hold irrational beliefs propagate the most – Mormons, Muslims, Orthodox Jews, the rural illiterate of all religions. Is irrationality then not a better survival and propagation strategy? Doesn't that explain through evolution theory why the numbers of the faithful are on the rise? Faith probably provides the moral backbone to withstand hardships in raising lots of children which science does not. 

Back to numbers. What does *-1x-1* mean? *-1x1* means one of *-1*. *-1x0* means none of *-1.* *-1x-1* could mean *1* of *-1* with the sign reversed or mirrored across the y-axis by convention. There might not be a deeper meaning. Likewise *i* could by convention mean CW rotation through 90 degrees in the Cartesian plane. A point on the unit circle can be represented by (*cos θ, sin θ*). A complex number in the form *x + iy* could by convention be used to represent a point on the Cartesian plane since the real and imaginary parts don't mix and we can do mathematical operations more easily now on 2d numbers. Combining trigonometry and complex numbers gives us the elegant *r cos θ + i r sin θ* representation for a number on the Cartesian plane, further abbreviated by Euler's remarkable identity to *r.e^iθ*. Radians are just fractions of the circumference of the unit circle (*2π*). Alternate methods for representing Cartesian points could be a system where a whole rotation is 100 degrees, a system consisting of the pair (distance from origin, number of rotations around the origin) etc. 

We wake up at 3:30 and get ready. I shower while these two don't. Very refreshing. We check out at 5:15 and head to gate E after train and security check. Swiss business lounge is not yet open so kill a few minutes in waiting area downstairs. Enter lounge at 6. 

Have a nice breakfast. Strawberry yogurt, muesli, cheese, baked beans, apple juice, cappuccino. Shonu has yogurt, cucumber, pickle, baked beans and cheese. She has two helpings of baked beans. They don't have any eggless bread. Shonu has iced decaf caramel latte macchiato, aunty has milk chai. Feeling complete. Relax in the relaxing area on recliners with a panoramic view of the runway. 

Head to gate around 8:30. On the way stop at a Pret and buy a hummus wrap and chips for Shonu. Gate is chock full of desis. There is the unwelcome passport control queue which is at least shorter for business class. Some economy passengers have joined the business queue and the staff are kind enough to call business passengers to the front. Airlines already do this check when they issue the boarding pass so why this redundancy is required is a mystery. No other country seems to require this step. Again, the mindless bureaucracy extends its tentacles beyond Indian borders. We can tell that the airline staff are harried and frustrated by the additional work and the constant rule breaking and general unruliness that is the hallmark of these flights. 

Aircraft is older and not as nice as the last one. Me and Shonu are seated together in the middle in row number 12. Aunty has the window throne next to us. 

Finish watching Kaagaz 2 movie. It has finally revealed itself as a plea against blocking roads and public nuisance caused by political rallies and demonstrations. Anupam Kher as a lawyer fighting pro bono cases for public causes and the late Satish Kaushik as the suffering common man are excellent. Kiran Kumar as the judge also appears very distinguished. The rest of the cast is passable. 

Buy WiFi to check ingredients on the bag of chips we bought at Pret. The food is disappointing. The two course meal is slow and overkill. It takes a long time for the second course to come and when it does come, it is bland. This time it's some paneer curry and avial with rice, a curious combination. Shonu and aunty get palak paneer and baingan bharta. Not terribly appetizing. 

The WiFi pass lets us view cricket score for India vs England 2nd test at Edgbaston. I try the willow app and to my surprise it is streaming. India bats first. Rahul is out for 2 with Jaiswal and Karun Nair rebuilding. Nair looks good when driving but is misjudging line on occasion. 

My seat won't recline flat so the crew give me an empty seat to take a nap. Take a 3 hour nap. No appetite so we don't have dinner. It is raining and a little bumpy but we land just a little behind schedule at 9:45pm. A blast of humidity and phenol greets us as we exit the aircraft. The vestibules at the gates are the first impression a visitor has of a country and as such not keeping them welcoming and smelling good is a missed opportunity. A very long expedition to reach immigration. There is a queue for foreign passports for business class which is short. A plane from Saudi seems to have arrived bearing a large crowd of pilgrims. They are emerging from the structured queue and lining up right behind a counter creating chaos. There are fewer agents for foreign passports and these people are lining up at that desk as well. We get a lady agent who seems like she is new to the job. She takes a long time to process our passports but there are no hitches. By the time I get a trolley, these two have collected the baggage. Apparently bags were tagged as priority. We book an uber XL and head out to P4 parking area. It takes us less than an hour to exit the airport from touchdown. Must be a record. 

The P4 level is chaotic and crowded. Struggle to find the Uber XL pickup area. Rather than assign an individual driver, the app gives a code to be given to the next available driver. We huff and puff our way to the pickup point and find a driver. Load the bags with some help from random bystanders or cabbies. At least it is a nice car – Innova – and the AC is on. The maps is routing via SV road and Versova road. It is raining, quite hard at times. Reach by 11:15. First gate is open and driver just misses it but backs up and heads in. Watchman is there and helps us lug the bags in the lift. Give him a small tip. 

Appa looks Ok. He is walking without a stick and in good spirits. Keeps asking us what we want to eat and if he should order something. Not hungry at the moment. We freshen up, and have the leftover food we carried - the Pret wrap and the paratha. Shonu is having an animated cricket discussion with Tatha. We turn in around 12:30. 

#### July 3, 2025

Wake up at 6. Appa makes coffee. 

Nisha comes at 9. Shonu has dosa for breakfast. We have sabudana khichdi. 

Aloo gobi and dal for lunch. 

Anjali bookstore. Shonu got Percy Jackson, a Hauser pen, 2 Marvel comic books, 11th and 12th grade NCERT Mathematics textbooks. 

Appa accidentally books tickets for Sitaare Zameen Par at PVR Juhu for today instead of tomorrow. We decide to go anyway. Take an Uber. Have to climb two sets of stairs to reach our seats which is not ideal for Appa but he manages. Movie is about a basketball coach who has to train a team with disabilities as community service for a traffic accident. It is heartwarming and funny. The disabled actors are all sweet and natural, a breath of fresh air. Aamir Khan is methodical and funny as the reluctant and obnoxious coach who is taught a life lesson by the disabled players. During interval Appa has a fall on the ridiculous stairs in the theater but nothing serious. Shonu gets a Pepsi. Me and Appa decide to take some unoccupied seats that don't require climbing stairs after the break. The movie builds to a fairytale finish but avoids the cliched ending for an inclusive message and camaraderie. It is heartwarming. 

Top ramen masala flavor for dinner. 

#### July 4, 2025

Wake up at 2:30. Go back to sleep at 4. Wake up at 7. 

Veg sandwich for breakfast. Sambar, rasam, avial made by Kamini for lunch. Payasam for dessert. Paratha and mix veg made by Nisha. Leftovers for dinner. 

#### July 5, 2025

![Taj Palace](../../../img/taj-hotel.jpg)
<span class="credit">Taj Palace Hotel</span>

Breakfast of dosa made by Kamini. Brunch of aloo beetroot paratha which is somewhat bland. 

Leave for Taj at 1 reach by 2:30, passing over Sealink, Coastal Road and a long undersea tunnel, which the driver informs us is newly built. Rooms 326 and 335. Uncomfortable with the fawning attention of the staff. Feel like we still haven't let go traditional servile attitudes. Have to shed all this to be a modern self-assured nation. I am reminded also of an episode when I tried to enter the hotel with a couple of college friends during my engineering days, and was denied entry due to not being guests. Life has come full circle.

Went to Gateway of India across the road but it was bursting at the seams, a river of humanity in spate. Appa had a tough time with getting up and down from the footpath and the asphyxiating human traffic. Went to patisserie which is in the rightmost corner of the hotel. Got some chocolate truffles in fancy box.   

Watching India vs England game. 

Dinner at Loya North Indian restaurant. Chaat platter appetizers – aloo chat, dahi chile, tomato sev.  Main course: saag with 3 greens and lotus root and baby potato bhey aloo, a paratha that was shaped like a ball, a mixed bajra jowar wheat roti, mango lassi with saffron for Shonu and Tatha. I share lassi with Tatha. The presentation and branding is nice and the flavors are excellent, but I can't help but think that they are standing on the shoulders of the unknown and unsung creative giants who invented the original dishes.  

#### July 6, 2025

<span class="credit">Art</span>

Breakfast at Sea Lounge at 9. I have bonda, masala idli, dosa and cappuccino and filter coffee. Tatha has the same. Shonu has 3 Danish pastries, chocolate pancake, cafe latte and masala chai. Aunty has pastries, bonda, dosa, hummus and pita, cafe latte and masala chai. 

![CST](../../../img/cst.jpg)
<span class="credit">CST</span>

Tatha rests while we take an exploratory walk of South Mumbai. Mantralaya, SBI quarters building where Meera chithi lived, Oval maidan and Rajabhai clock tower, Churchgate station where some rally was going on, Uber to CST, Shonu got 2 books from roadside bookseller – Reckless and Fearless, Uber back to hotel. 

Room service for lunch. Nachos and cheese, Margarita pizza, penne pasta with white sauce and badam halwa. 

Go down to pool area for live music and light show about history of Taj hotel. Arjun calls Tatha and we video chat. Tatha walks without wheelchair. 

![CST At Night](../../../img/cst-night.jpg)
<span class="credit">CST At Night</span>

Take a Uber around the area – Marine drive, Girgaum chowpatty, Nariman point, CST which was lit up, Kala Ghoda, and back. 

Watched cricket match. India winning against England. Had good day biscuits and cashews. 

#### July 7, 2025

Take Taj hotel tour by Percy who worked for 42 years in Taj airports division. He is an Anupam Kher clone. Jamsetji Tata built the hotel because there was a sign outside Watson hotel – "dogs and Indians not allowed". He wanted to build a hotel where all were welcome. It opened in 1903. Designed by Indian architects. Alternate entrance, grand staircase which is cantilevered, great dome made with same steel used in Eiffel Tower, six smaller domes, 2 wings, swimming pool, jharoka balconies with carved woodwork below, tower built by acquiring nearby hotel and road, ballrooms with gilded columns and crystal chandeliers, Sea Lounge restaurant which was originally outdoors and along the sea. Original room rent was 6 rupees. Presidential suite on 6th floor with 2 bedrooms, vast living room and pantry where heads of state stay, ballroom where instruments of transfer of power signed, inner architecture based on Maratha wadas. 5th and 6th floor were added later within the dome, burnt and destroyed by 26/11 terror attacks. Tower lobby is a later addition. There is a 26/11 memorial at the back of the tower lobby. 32 people died of which 20 were hotel staff including security dog Lucy. The terrorists entered from lobby entrance and side entrance near patisserie we visited earlier. 

Checkout at 12. Replicas of 1 paisa coins as mementos. Take Uber back and reach at 1:30. Mumbai for being the crown jewel of India could do a better job of trash collection, especially during the monsoon. Shortage of funds cannot be the excuse here. Indian art and culture is like a beautiful lily blooming in a pond of scum. 

Prakash comes at 7. Aunty has made podlangai and carrot curry, aloo mattar. Order paratha and pineapple sheera from zomato app. 

Office work starts from tonight. 

#### July 9, 2025

![Samrudhi Expressway](../../../img/samrudhi.jpg)
<span class="credit">Samrudhi Expressway</span>

Leave at 10 in Uber XL Intercity for Nashik. Driver is soft spoken Maharashtrian named Krushna. Hit traffic right off the bat. Winding through Lokhandwala and Oshiwara where Metro construction is in progress. Oshiwara is an ISO certified dump. Trash mixed with earth piled up endlessly on the sides of the road punctuated with festering rain puddles. An anarchic place with no functioning government it seems. In the midst of it all, stunted people on the margins of society eking out a subhuman existence. 

Powai is much cleaner and scenic with the lake. But still there is room for improvement. Lots of high rise apartments. Some have Roman columns and arches for inscrutable reasons. Most of them are spartan in design. Some ravaged by the tropical climate are sorely in need of paint. 

Throughout all these places wend the ugly piers and spans of the metro. A centipede with elephantiasis. The trains themselves are pleasant to look at. 

After about an hour we reach a highway – NH48 – which takes us through Mulund, Thane and across the Vasai Creek, out of Mumbai island and into mainland India – Bhiwandi, Kalyan, etc. This area is still suburban with tall residential towers sprouting across the landscape like mushrooms. Are there really that many people willing to live this far from Mumbai downtown?

The suburbs gradually recede and give way to verdant countryside with shabby restaurants, shops and factories lining the highway. Municipal services are conspicuous by their absence. The road starts resembling the lunar surface after a time. In the two years since we last traversed it, this road has stayed unchanged. How can incompetence be this extreme and flagrant? How can there be such bovine tolerance for corruption?

But then something magical happens. We turn off onto the highway to Nagpur after 2 hours of journey. This is a new six lane  highway that seems like it belongs in a different country. It is smooth, well paved, and modern with speed signs and overhead signs with distance and destination information at periodic intervals. There are also 3-4 toll plazas with futuristic roofs. They are fully automated, with cameras detecting license plate and opening the gate. 

The surrounding countryside is vivid green against the distant outline of the Sahyadri mountains. Villages occasionally zip by. The speed limit here is 120 kph or 75mph. A couple of grazing flocks of cattle and goat glide serenely by. The road then ascends as it curves up on a bridge of stilts. We pass under a mountain through a wide tunnel whose entrance is artistically decorated. More tunnels and more art. One with Warli art at its entrance. After emerging from another one, a needle shaped rock looming to the right surrounded by wispy rain clouds. An imposing cloud adorned precipice with yet another tunnel bored through its heart straight ahead. The Western Ghats in the monsoon are a magical, dreamlike place. A worthy rival to Germany and Switzerland for natural beauty. 

Lastly we enter the Igatpuri-Kasara tunnel, which welcomes us to the tongue twisting *Hindu Hrudaysamrat Balasaheb Thackeray Maharashtra Samruddhi Mahamarg* highway. In keeping with its name, it is a never ending tunnel, like the mines of Moria under the Misty Mountains. After nearly five concerned miles, there is light at the end of the tunnel. The exit to Nashik appears on the left soon. We have skirted around the serpentine and dangerous ghats altogether and emerged triumphant atop the Deccan plateau after starting from sea level. 

After a journey of four hours, we reach Nashik. Nashik the city is less dirty and chaotic than big sister Mumbai. Yet the same unpaved roads and mud. The AirBnb is in Indira Nagar, a bungalow called *Pitruchhaya* with an aesthetic gate. The highway is a toll road and a toll of Rs 305 has to be paid to the driver. The bungalow owner's brother has come to meet us and the owner comes shortly. His name is Manoj. He is a jovial character. 

We have the lower floor of the bungalow. There are two bedrooms, 2.5 bathrooms, a kitchen and a laundry room. The hall is a spacious expanse of granite flooring. The kitchen and bedrooms are also large with plenty of storage. Construction quality and attention to detail is atypical for India. There are thoughtful touches – bath towels, hand towels, hand, bath and dish soap, utensils and dinnerware, a pressure cooker, mosquito mats, a clothes drying rack, a dinner table and chairs, a microwave, a fridge, tea, sugar, salt, bathroom slippers, a reverse osmosis system for drinking water. This is a place we can comfortably have an extended stay in. 

He is also kind enough to take us shopping in his car. We get some vegetables and fruits (potato, onion, tomato, cilantro, cauliflower, gilki, mandarin orange, elaichi kela) from a produce shop, and yogurt, bread, rice, biscuits, coffee, diary milk chocolate and snacks from a mini mart. 

Back at the bungalow, a late lunch of top ramen noodles with amul cheese is had. This is followed by a leisurely nap. I wake up at 5 and boil tea. These two wake up at 6:30. 

Missed call from Ranade sir. Shonu calls back. He wants her to come tomorrow at 9:30am. 

For dinner, I cut gilki, onion and tomato. Aunty does the cooking. Rice is kept in the cooker. The parathas we have brought with us from Mumbai. She has work meetings from 7:30. Me and Shonu have dinner quietly. Aunty eats later at around 9:30. She has  a call after that as well. 

I journal, Shonu watches some spider man movie she has downloaded on iPad and we hit the sack at 11.  

#### July 10, 2025

I wake up early at 6:20, have coffee and get ready. These two stir much later at close to 8. 

Ranade sir calls and asks Shonu to be ready at 9:30 to meet his guru. I make chai for Shonu and aunty and Shonu gets ready and leaves with Ranade sir and his wife Divya at around 10:15. 

Me and Aunty sit around and chat.

Aunty makes aloo geela sabji and moong dal with parathas we brought, yogurt and rice. Shonu comes back at 12:30. She met her guru's guru. He has 25 cats! Shonu sang Nat bhairav. Grand guru said she sang well and to continue singing. He remarks to Ashish ji that she has a clear voice and good sense of taal. We have lunch and take a nap. Shonu has to go to gurukul at 3. Ashish ji comes and picks her up. 

![Gurukul](../../../img/gurukul.jpg)
<span class="credit">Gurukul</span>

We have chai and take an auto to gurukul a little later around 5. There, Shonu is learning *tejomai, baje muraliya* and *Nat bhairav.* She is singing well soaking in the gurukul's atmosphere. After this it is chai time. We have elaichi chai in microscopic cups. Then the guru Poornima function gets underway. Shonu does arati of guru, touches his feet and gets blessings. Coincidentally both her in person sessions have started on guru Poornima. 

After the function, her guru leads a grim bandish in Raag Marwa – *Guru bina gyan na paave*. Aunty has work call so we leave after this. 

Leftovers from lunch for dinner. We both work and Shonu watches cricket which is a crushing bore. Bazball has turned into tuktukball. I am stuck on a stubborn work problem that needs coordination with other teams so stay up till 12:30-1 but can't make headway. 

#### July 11, 2025

Wake up by 7 despite retiring late last night. Start up laptop without even brushing teeth. Thought of some ideas for the work issue as soon as I woke up and don't want them to evaporate like dreams. Make chai for aunty, mocha for junior aunty and coffee for myself. Then some more ideas are generated and one of them which involves scrutinizing the code pays off. New fields which weren't being added to a database were only added on insert and not on update. As with most issues, what started with a bang ends with a whimper. Solving this one issue enables me to wrap up a lot of other work that depended on it. 

Cucumber and cheese toast sandwich for breakfast. Shonu has caught a mild cold. She says it is allergic. She downs two glasses of black tea stowed from Taj. 

Aunty has made veg pulav for lunch. After lunch, one of the students from the gurukul, Sakshi, picks up Shonu around 1 on way to gurukul. Shonu has never sat on a scooter so a bit nervous. 

Get some more office work done to be able to sleep early tonight. We take a short nap, have chai and then take a walk to gurukul. On the way, right outside the bungalow we spot a store with dahi in the freezer and stop to get dahi and paneer. These are stowed in the fridge and then we take a walk. A growling contest between a pet dog and a stray ahead of us forces us to take a detour. The path is mostly through inner streets. Just one street with traffic has to be crossed which isn't too hard. There are many shops along the way. A clothes shop. An ice cream, cake and shakes shop named Limbu Timbu. A pav bhaji and chineej place. A ladeej tailor. Walking is a great way to get a feel for a place. Nashik has a small town feel with lots of row houses and bungalows and small streets but there are also the odd 6-7 story apartment buildings. It is much more loosely strung than Mumbai with a pleasant climate thanks to its plateau location. However, the smell of garbage is pervasive. Is this just a monsoon phenomenon? The gurukul is reached after a brisk 15 minute walk. 

There, Shonu and other kids are just sitting around after a session. Ashish ji is also sitting. We are to go to a location for a concert tomorrow. This is not the same location as Sunday's concert. The three of us go in his car with Durva, picking up Adhira on the way from her classes. She is a chatterbox. 

We stop outside a huge bungalow in a relatively open area. Up a wide flight of black granite stairs with no railings into an expansive living room with very high ceiling. The house belongs to a former student of his who has relocated to Nashik from Dubai. The house is still being moved into as an uninstalled fridge in the kitchen indicates. The other students have come in another car driven by a gentleman we met in the gurukul named Ramesh Marathi. He has a bungalow which he rents out as an AirBnb. Ashish ji had mentioned this place to us when we were looking for a place to stay earlier. We decided against it because of poor approach roads and distance from gurukul. 

They are clearing furniture and putting up a banner for tomorrow's concert. Adhira is walking around copying them, decorating the chairs with plastic garlands, talking to herself and everyone in marathi. She reminds us of small Shonu. Wiry, talking whether or not someone is listening, and full of energy. I try my rusted marathi on her with some success. She does some dancing as well.  Shonu was like this at her age, unselfconscious and ready to break into a dance. We leave in an auto after some chai since Aunty has to take an interview. 

Maggi Pazzta for dinner. 

#### July 12, 2025

Spend morning wrapping up office work. Cucumber and cheese sandwich for breakfast. Shonu says that the Airbnb owner took her to meet the lady next door, who was chief guest at her concert here in 2023. 

These two chat with Appa in morning and then with Arjun in Singapore. It is post lunch for him – he is 2.5 hours ahead. 

Pazzta and leftover pulav for lunch. Then a very brief nap for 15 mins. Ashish ji arrives to pick up Shonu at around 2:30. I have chai. Before Aunty wakes up, Shonu is back around 4. 

We have to go to a house concert featuring a singer from mumbai at 6:30 at the same house we visited yesterday. 

Saraf Nagar is a 5 minute auto ride. The bungalow is packed. Malhar, the healthy kid from gurukul greets at the entrance with a roll on fragrance. Audience is seated on the floor. We find a spot and sit down. Sakshi offers us coffee. It is milky and sweet. 

Some speeches preface the singing. Ashish ji mentions that this setting provides an opportunity for students to listen from close quarters and engage with musicians. The artiste is Shruti Marathe from mumbai. She is young and cheerful. Starts with Raag bhupali. She is a good singer with a powerful voice and good command over the medium. Can see the audience including Shonu  nodding and appreciating. The alaaps as well as tans are rendered with grace and power. We leave at the end of the piece in order to have dinner and go to bed early. 

Dinner is top ramen with paneer. Shonu relaxes by watching cricket. Indian lower order batting well. 

#### July 13, 2025

![Concert](../../../img/concert.jpg)
<span class="credit">Concert</span>

Concert day today. Wake at 5 and get ready. Ashish ji and Divya come to pick us up at 6:15. We reach the venue at 6:40 – Vishwas Garden about 25 mins away. Shonu has to hold a tanpura in her lap but it isn't heavy. 

*Sur Vishwas* is a monthly morning concert series held on the 3rd Sunday of each month. Ashish ji specially requested the organizers to move it to the 2nd Sunday for this month to accommodate Shonu and they graciously agreed. 

The organizer is friendly and we are offered chai. It is an outdoor setting with a couple of cricket and soccer practice areas nearby. There is seating for about 200 people but nobody is there yet. 

I wonder how many people will turn up at this early hour on a Sunday to listen to a classical concert. 

Divya ji is accompanying on harmonium and Rasik Kulkarni on tabla. Rasik ji and Ashish ji's respective gurus used to play tabla and sing with each other and now the disciples are continuing the tradition. At the last minute, Ashish ji takes tanpura from Shonu and gives it to Durva. Concert starts soon after 7. 

One mami gives a nice introduction in Marathi for Shonu. Shonu makes some remarks in Hindi. Ashish ji had given her a script in English which I translated into Hindi. She has improvised on that. She adds that she lives in Los Angeles and thought that music was only about sur and taal. But after coming to India and studying in gurukul she feels it is about the experience, about what the listeners feel and how she reacts to that. 

First piece is in Nat Bhairav. *Kal na pare, more piya tuma bina sagari ratiyaan.* Chota khyal is *bairana bhayi raina dina* followed by Ashish ji's composition *more man ki vidhaan jaane tarap tarapa tarase naina*. I think there is too much reverb but these two disagree. Her performance is very good, especially the complex taans, her hand gestures and the confidence with which she is singing. 

Next piece is a natya sangeet. *Tejo nidhi loha gola, bhaskara he gaganaraja.* She gets the pronunciations spot on. This is a difficult song according to her guru and she does very well. 

She finishes with a traditional bhajan *Baje muraliya.* She does numerous variations, some her guru's and some her own. 

The audience appreciates her with generous applause and encouragement. The organizers make concluding remarks praising her performance and pronunciation for someone so young and unfamiliar with the language. They also mention that this music has come all the way from Los Angeles and it is a matter of pride for them that they have something of value for which someone would come all the way from America for. This is followed by Misal pau breakfast. Shonu has idli which Aunty made for her. Misal pau is spicy but tasty.

<span class="credit">Pandavleni Caves</span>

Ashish ji drops us back. Shonu takes a short nap after which we take an Uber to Pandavleni caves nearby. These are 1st century BC Buddhist caves carved from rock. The name is a misnomer. They have nothing to do with the pandavas from the Mahabharat. They are quite a way up a steep hill. Get some good exercise climbing the stairs. Shonu is sulking. The stench of garbage is  unfortunate and the monsoon isn't helping. Many people are making the climb including small kids who are having a great time. 

Buy tickets and pay Indian citizen price by talking in Marathi. Entry is free for Shonu. The exterior is ornate with carvings. Shonu refuses to remove her footwear to go inside. I do and take a peek. It is dark and spartan. There are many rooms. These are *viharas* – meditation and living quarters for monks. It must have been lit with torches all day when in use. Now it is the abode of bats and the stench is unpleasant. 

Then there is a cathedral sized *chaitya* or meditation hall featuring a massive stupa and pillars on either side. There are stairs leading up to further viharas. Shonu refuses to climb them but we convince her. It is wet and muddy and she gets her pants dirty and sulks some more. 

Off to one side is a carving of Hanuman in the rock next to a tree. It isn't known if this pre or post dates the Buddhist structures. But it is nice to see the peaceful coexistence of religions.

There are panoramic views of the city from up here. It is a much bigger city than we imagined. Lots of apartment buildings. The Sahyadris loom in the far distance. 

We walk around to the other side. There are more caves at ground level, one with carvings of the Buddha. Shonu's patience is wearing thin and we start our descent. I tell her to not let external circumstances disturb her. Look at the people around who are not well off yet happy and enjoying themselves. Travelling and seeing those less well off helps us better appreciate what we have. 

We take a rickshaw to McDonalds. There we have a veg burger and fries. Shonu and aunty take canned Coke Zero, not trusting the fountain drinks. There are other vegetarian options such as paneer and aloo tikki but they are prefixed with McSpicy which rules them out. The burger is underwhelming. No spice and the sauces – veg mayo and mustard – are weird. Back to the Airbnb after this and a longer nap till 5:30. Ashish ji has invited us for dinner at 7. 

We walk over. His house is 10 minutes away. He meets us midway and takes us. His house number 11 is on the 5th floor of a building called Saloni. Adhira is there. She is dressed very cutely in a kurta and loose pant and has got some make up on. "Eye shadow" she says. Shonu gives her the doll we brought. Aunty opens it up. She loves it. I ask her what the doll's name is and she immediately replies "Elsa". Then when the costume is changed to a pink one, she changes the name to "Pinky". She is a sweetheart. Such a bright and cheerful child. 

I don't feel so confident when speaking Marathi with adults but feel comfortable talking with her. Maybe because I am only speaking in phrases and not whole sentences. She wants to serve us dinner in plates and when her mother doesn't allow her to, she cutely sulks in a chair with folded arms. She refuses to even pose for a photo. 

Ashish ji is showing some videos of his performances and giving some tips to Shonu on how to space things out when singing. 

Pav bhaji dinner is served. For me and aunty there is also a pulav since they weren't sure if it is peanut free. The Pav bhaji is from a shop and although he says it is nut free, Shonu still does a taste test as precaution. It is tasty though a little spicy. A hot strawberry and semia kheer is served for dessert. This is very tasty. Adhira reprimands her mother for not warning her that it is hot. 

Kamini plays Ken's tracks for Ashish ji and he starts trying to fit khyals onto them. 

Shonu is gifted a lunch box by her sir. He had ordered a t shirt with a tanpura print but it didn't arrive in time. 

When we leave, Adhira gifts her panda to Shonu and says she must take it. Shonu awkwardly refuses to take it. We take leave and walk back home. Watch Indian batting imploding against England before going to bed. 

#### July 14, 2025

Idli upma breakfast. Go out to get toilet paper. No medical shop has it. Find it in supermarket we went to on the first day. Ashish ji drops off jalebi. Mix veg and yogurt rice for lunch. 

Durva picks up Shonu at 1. 

Take a nap. Shonu calls around 3 saying her sir wants to take them for a drive to see "*baarish*". Around 4 or 4:30 she is back. 

Match is all but lost after quick wickets on day 5. 

Have leftovers for dinner. Do some office work. 

#### July 15, 2025

Biscuits and coffee/chai for breakfast. Some office work till 12. Me and Kamini go to nearby Kashish clothes shop to buy loose pants for Shonu and her. Get cheese and yogurt from nearby shop and bread from bakery next to Gopal food hub. 

Khichdi with yogurt and chips for lunch. 

Durva picks up Shonu at 2:30. We both take a short nap, have chai and walk over to Gurukul. Shonu and Durva are the only students. Shonu is learning *Raag Brindavani sarang* bandish – *Tum rab tum saahib*. This is very complex. Her sir says the alaaps and taans for this Raag are very delicate. He talks about tone and the importance of volume control to retain sweetness. 

His rendition of this Raag is magnificent. He mentions that this version is Bhimsen Joshi's and that he has listened to it more than 500 times. He used to listen to the same song for 3 hours daily to and from work for 3-4 years. He advises Shonu to listen more to great singers. Pick someone you want to follow. He stresses the "impact" of a famous rendition as being the next level up from mere technical correctness. If you listen enough, the material embeds into your brain and singing becomes automatic. 

We take leave at 5:30 since aunty has meeting at 7. Shonu takes blessings of her guru. He seems sad that she is going so soon. We are also sad to be leaving. 

Order pizza from dominoes. Zomato wants a local number and OTP which expires before I can even get it from Appa. Order from Swiggy which doesn't require a local number. It is also cheaper. Arrives in 30 minutes. Achari do pyaza with paneer and margherita. Both are good. 

Finish packing. Take sick day at work. I have a headache. Anyway I wouldn't be able to work in the morning. 

Go to bed by 9:30. 

#### July 16, 2025

Wake up at 5. Make chai and get ready. We are all ready by 6:15. Call Uber at 6:30. Ride confirmed and driver will arrive in 10 mins. Airbnb owner is on his way too. Driver comes with a boy in the front seat. Makes a fuss about putting the rear seats down for luggage. Then is surprised that destination is Mumbai. Says something about Uber vehicles being attacked in Mumbai and wants to do the ride but as a private operator. The guy doesn't inspire confidence and we ask him to cancel and unload the luggage. I book another Uber. Arriving in 10 minutes. I call the driver to ask if intercity is OK. He says yes but asks to convert to a private ride since Uber drivers in Mumbai are on strike. Asks for Rs 4200 - Rs 600 more than Uber's rate. We agree since we have a time constraint. 

Start around 7:30 and take Samruddhi expressway at Igatpuri. Road is clear and only occasional light showers. Driver, a UP bhaiya, narrates his woes with traffic police and the state of roads. After we exit Samruddhi onto NH48, call Appa and tell him to order some small packs of shrikhand for us to carry. Hit some traffic as we enter Thane. It could apparently have been far worse according to the driver. It once took him 11 hours to reach Churchgate from Nashik. 

Route takes us through SEEPZ and I show them the entrance. I worked here for 3 years till 1998. On Mahakali Caves road there are some people in white aggressively stopping cabs and asking the drivers to come out. Our car is also stopped but our driver tells them he is "fixed" rate fare and not ridesharing app and they let him go. A nervous moment. Our driver tells us that these are cabbies. Finally reach home at 11:30. 

Greeted by Nisha as soon as the lift reaches 6th floor. Appa is also standing outside the door in the sun. He is very happy and excited to see us even if for a short while. 

He has ordered not only shrikhand, but also dahi, rabri and kheer. We repack, removing inessential stuff. Have lunch at 12:30. Cauliflower curry, dal and thair shadam followed by rabri (therati paal) for dessert. Aunty has a nap while me and Shonu chat with Appa about the caves we visited, how it was poorly maintained and stinking, to how government isn't maintaining priceless heritage sites, to how Indians don't deserve democracy, how the US is propping up dictatorial regimes, and general geopolitics. Leave at 2 since we don't know the traffic situation due to the strike. The driver is an Mcom and so is his wife. But he chooses to drive Uber because he loves to drive. He apparently earns more than in a desk job. 

He mistakenly takes us to CST. Have to redirect him to Mumbai Central from there, an additional 15 mins. Pay him 1200 since he drove extra, Uber isn't available and he waited for us. 

Sit at platform 1. Train 12951 is already there but not yet open to board. The exterior of the coaches has beautiful artwork. It is hot and muggy. Shonu is already complaining. Buy her (and us) Amul rose lassi which cools us down a little. Shonu is using portable fan to stay cool. 

Train doors open at 4:25. Our seats are 48,49,50. 49,50 are a lower and an upper berth in the same 2-berth cabin right next to the door while 48 is the side upper berth in the adjacent cabin. The cabin is reasonably clean by Indian standards. There are mosquitos and the spray comes out. 

Train starts at 5 sharp. It is a smooth ride with occasional stops at signals and jerky starts. Snacks are served – kachori, veg sandwich, peanut millet chikki, poha chiwda of which Shonu  can't have anything much. Me and Kamini share a chiwda packet. We all have wagh bakri chai which is very hot but has flavor. Shonu has chips from Nashik. 

We go past Malad and halt in Borivli. We could have boarded here. It would have been slightly quicker to reach than Mumbai central. Oh well. 

We go past shabby apartments in Vasai-Virar and Nala Sopara (reminds us of Sapna from Kapil Sharma Show) with wide open trash filled drains in front of them. These are not natural ditches. Someone consciously designed this atrocity. Why is impossible to fathom. It is constructed to be a breeding ground for diseases besides looking and smelling disgusting. Why people living here willingly accept this abomination is a mystery. Is this the culmination of a philosophy that prioritizes inner versus external growth, or merely a civic administration sorely lacking in training and funds allied with a citizenry made apathetic by their own impotence, or the tolerant and non-organizing nature of Indians that leads to people not caring about the world immediately outside their doorstep? Then again this is a nation of slogans. *Swachh Bharat, garibi hatao, mera desh mahaan, saare jahan se achha, athithi devo bhavah*. Putting in the thought and the work required to make the slogans a reality is harder. If the guest is God, then one must not invite them unless the house is cleaned. 

The countryside is incredibly scenic especially in the monsoon. Small rivers are crossed. Many of these bridges were probably built by my grandfather, who was a civil engineer with the railways. As we speed past Vapi, the buildings turn even shabbier. We wonder what people living near smaller stations do for a living. Factory workers, local businesses, farm hands, retirees?

A discussion is had about the broken window theory. A single broken window that remains unfixed in a building incentivizes miscreants to break more. Likewise, a single uncollected piece of trash gives license to add to the collection. The only solution is to invest in daily trash collection and track KPIs. Over time a civic sense will develop necessitating less frequent collections. Automation and robots are the future, not manual trash gathering. Budgets have to be reconfigured to allocate more funds to trash management and civic hygeine. This is an essential investment for the public health first and foremost, civic beauty and tourism second and third. Why administrations of different hues have refused to accord highest priority to this area in 78 years of independence is a mystery, a scandal and a matter of national shame. On the other hand, the benefits of investing in this area can have spectacular payoffs not only in improved public health, sanitation and beauty but in increased tourism revenue and national image and self confidence. 

The theplas made by Nisha are had with achar at 7:30. They are soft and savory and much welcome since the train food doesn't agree with us. Cadbury dairy milk chocolate for dessert is the icing on the cake. 

Aunty has meetings from 8-11. How she is able to concentrate in the din and bustle of the carriage, with vendors hawking goods from time to time is a wonder.  

Shonu watches Enola Holmes movie on iPad, I listen to Seen and the Unseen podcast, we read Hindustan Times newspaper, take small naps. 

Surat passes by in the dusk. Lots of red neon signs on hotels and buildings. Supposedly this is one of the cleaner cities. Why can't the solutions developed here and in other cities like Indore be applied nationwide?

The Narmada river between Ankleshwar and Bharuch passes underneath. It is one of the most important rivers in India and the biggest river flowing west into the Arabian Sea, from its origin in Amarkantak in MP in the Maikal range. 

Amul ice cream is offered by an attendant and accepted by Shonu. It is a vanilla flavor and very tasty according to her. 

An electronic board has been installed with journey information and other exhortations one of which reads: "Avoid consuming liquor in the carriage". 

Ratlam rolls around 200 kms after Dahod. The train slows down from 130kmph to about 60 but then gathers speed to 90. Ratlam station is reached just after 12:25am. 

One of the attendants, poor fellow, is sleeping on the floor right outside one of the doors. We try to wake him but he's deep in slumber. Another attendant sleeping in a berth above him tells us that the platform is on the other side. To make him look foolish, the platform arrives on the same side and he has to hastily wake up the sleeping fellow who appears dazed and bewildered. 

Meenu and Om Prakash greet us. Om Prakash helps get our luggage down and tries to carry all three bags. We manage to snatch one back. There are elevators thankfully. Outside, bags are loaded into an auto rickshaw. Meenu and Aunty sit in it while me and Shonu follow with Om Prakash in the car. He thinks that the bags and all of us could have fit in the car and the auto was overkill. Possibly. 

We inquire about him and Ratlam. Many roads are being converted into four lane with dividers. He takes us on one of the old roads that still hasn't been "upgraded". His son is also in 9th grade like Shonu. But he isn't a good student and has just scraped through. His daughter is better and got an academic award for 12th grade. She is now studying arts in college. 

We reach the home before the auto. Greeted by Amma and Appa. The auto arrives shortly. We unpack a little, change, brush and go to bed by 2am. 

#### July 17, 2025

Wake up just before 9 after good night's rest. Aunty is already up but Shonu is sleeping. Amma makes chai with homemade chai masala which wakes us up. She has made butte ka khis and puran poli for breakfast. Ratlami sev is sprinkled on the upma. Tasty fare. 

Shonu wakes up a little later. 

Radha chithi calls and talks for a while, inquiring about Appa and our visit so far. 

Shonu meets Gurwinder who has grown into a giant. He is still very courteous and friendly. 

We inspect Thatha and Meenu's considerable book collection with interest. Shonu picks out an Agatha Christie book to read. 

After a bucket bath, we sit for lunch. Special menu. Beans curry, sambhar, paruppu podi, sev and potato chips. Wah wah. A delicious smorgasboard to welcome us. 

Nap till 5:30. Make chai. Akshay and Vishal stop by. After some chit chat about movies, Akshay takes me on his scooter for shopping. Have to buy pedal dustbins and cleaning supplies. We pass through some open drains and garbage mounds on the way. Why don't people demand more of their elected officials? Have chai at a farm fresh "startup". It is served in tiny cups and is incredibly tasty with elaichi. The milk feels fresh - like it was just extracted. He is interested in American politics and geopolitics and its impact on the global economy. He is going to Dubai for an FMCG expo. He wants to start a garment business with a cousin.  

Next he takes me to Sarvanand but it is closed on Thursday. He tries Reliance mall. It is brand new and spotless. Modeled on Target or Walmart. 

Everything on my list is there except pedal dustbins. For that we have to go to another shop and yet another for trash bags. The lady running the shop looks at the dustbin to estimate the size but it turns out to be not big enough to avoid slipping into the bin. None of my credit cards (including Appa's) work here. Akshay pays using Paytm and I promise to reimburse him. I ask him about his sev business. He says it is going well but he wants to expand and rebrand and increase shelf life to 6 months. But that will require substantial investment and growing the business first to offset the investment expenses. 

Back at the house, savory masala idli for dinner. Boondi ladoo for dessert. The gastronomic pampering continues. Having connectivity issues from my laptop. Can't get internet from Jio on laptop and phone hotspot is also very slow. As luck has it, there are many outstanding questions I have to research. 

Appa calls and chat with him for some time. 

Able to get better signal in living room. Work till 2am. 

#### July 18, 2025

Wake up at 8:30. Bread roll for breakfast. Superb.   

Tasty Palak paneer and kundru for lunch.  

Jio guy is here to install WiFi. Wants Aadhar card and photo against white background. The app won't accept Amma's photo but takes Appa's. Probably because she wasn't still while posing for the photo. This Aadhar requirement for SIM, WiFi etc is not tourist friendly since passports won't be accepted in lieu of aadhar. 

Nap while Jio guy is doing his thing. After nap WiFi is available and speeds are good. Around 30Mbps. Get some office work going. Much better than phone hotspot. Still frustrating because large volumes of data have to be downloaded for my present task and connecting to US servers is still relatively slow. Most of the day is spent waiting. 

Carrom game after tea. Aunty and Shonu are cheating openly. 

Delicious achari and plain parathas made by Kamini and Meenu for dinner with kundru and palak paneer.

Talk to Appa after dinner. Shonu and Aunty also chat. 

Piece of balushahi for dessert. Because one sweet dish is never enough. Get office work done by 11. Most of the day was spent in setting up system locally. Turns out to be Postgres query syntax error. 

#### July 19, 2025

![Terrace Garden](../../../img/terrace-garden.jpg)
<span class="credit">Terrace Garden</span>

Wake up at 7. Have coffee. Poha breakfast. 

Paratha, gobi aloo, green chana, bharwa mirchi, paruppu podi rice for lunch. I am a fan of the paruppu podi. Bharwa mirchi is icing on the cake.

Nap till 5. 

Meenu and Aunty make social visits to Raju and Shashi didi. Raju is not well and no longer drives an auto. Shonu, Aunty and me visit Gurwinder house at 6:30. A curious dog looks for a meal in the gift bag containing chocolates attracting others. We hasten back before the grandmother chases them away with a stick. 

The mother and father and grandmother chat with us about Punjabis in America, California fires, Texas floods, hockey, cakes made to order by the mother, her instagram account, job market in India (bad according to the father), coming of AI, career choices – Gurwinder is still unsure but is going to Pune to study commerce/CA with his brother Amarinder who has studied computer science and is working as a SAP consultant, the father who is a mechanical engineer, how engineering trains for general problem solving and engineers can fit into other fields with the reverse not being true, etc. A snack of spicy corn and plum cake is served. Shonu has just cake which is egg free and has elaichi, nutmeg and clove/pepper. A photo of Shonu and Gurwinder is taken before we leave. They barely fit in the same frame. Om Prakash is here to take us to Chabbra ji's 999 dukaan. He worked in Ambi Mama's factory. We are offered hot coffee. I select 3 collared t-shirts after making them take out 40-50 shirts. 

Pizza with cheese and corn for lunch. Unfortunately, Shonu can't have because of corn. She has paratha and cauliflower curry. 

#### July 20, 2025


Relaxing Sunday. Rich decoction coffee in morning made by Amma. Mini masala idli for breakfast. 

Gilki and dal for lunch. Getting to taste a wide variety of the local produce. 

One Soni aunty (Madhuri) comes by in evening as carrom game is in progress. She is a neighbor who sings bhajans with a group. Shonu made to sing baje muraliya and bolava vithala. Aunty sings bhajan – Ram ka gungaan keejiye. The mami also reluctantly sings with the disclaimer that she isn't a trained singer. It is rough but not harsh on the ear. 

Mina Jain and Rudrakshi come in evening bringing aloo wada which is delicious. Eat 3-4. Parvati brings dal baati at 9. Jumbo baatis. Eat 1/2 and feel full. Very tasty though a touch spicy.

![Kedareshwar](../../../img/kedareshwar.jpg)
<span class="credit">Kedareshwar</span>

3 dosas for breakfast. Overeat. 

Kedareshwar waterfalls and Sailana cactus garden with Om Prakash at 10. Scenic route with rolling and green terrain. Pass Mumbai-Delhi expressway. A walking trail descends to the falls. Stairs lead behind the falls to a ledge where a temple has been built. We don't visit the temple. More stairs lead down towards a stream which leads to another set of falls. We have to cross a stream which is slightly challenging. Om Prakash is also helping. Hot and humid. 

We are hot and sweaty after the uphill walk back to the car. Drive with windows open for a while then with AC. Next stop – Sailana cactus garden. It is in Sailana town. We have some sugary cheese and Jain biscuits and water. We pass an "I ❤️ Sailana" sign in front of a pond or a lake and enter narrow streets leading to a fortified entrance winding uphill. A sign says "private residence of Raja Vikram Singh ji". We enter a broad courtyard with a white palace. There is a fountain in the foreground. A well bred dog sleeps regally on the verandah. Om Prakash parks in a shaded spot but an attendant directs us to park in a spot in the baking sun. Om Prakash manages to wedge the car into a partially shaded spot.

<span class="credit">Sailana Cactus</span>

We are told to watch out for a beehive as we enter. A little Hanuman temple on the way to the tall and ornate wooden gate through which we enter the garden. Lots of cactuses of various sizes. One has a white flower. Another has several weeping white flowers. There are aloe and pineapple shaped cactuses, giant cactuses with arms folded in prayer to the heavens. It is a small garden and we soon exit to the side or back of the palace fronted by another fountain. There are some ornate *chabutaras* (shrines) without any deities. This is a common Rajasthani motif. We are too tired to visit the museum also in the palace. We hear some peacocks as we make our way to the car, which Om Prakash has managed to park in the original shaded spot. We are back home in 40 minutes after detouring into a side street for photos of an ornate tower. There are stork like birds, many of them, in the trees nearby. 

Dal bati from yesterday for lunch with leftover gilki with sev tamatar. Me and Shonu take a nap in AC. Aunty has gone with Amma for shopping. Shonu and Aunty do more shopping in evening. Get dresses for concert. 

Mac n cheese pasta with white sauce for dinner. A nice change to mix things up.

Office work in evening. Aunty has headache or indigestion and goes to bed early. I stay up till 12:30. 

#### July 22, 2025

2 dosas for breakfast. 

Visit Vyas ji's school – Sapphire School. Their driver arrives to take us. It is a K-12 CBSE school about 15 minutes from the city. The campus is spacious. There is a large 3 story building in front, and a smaller 2 story one in the back. The principal, Shilpika meets us at the front. Shonu has hockey PTSD since her coach is also named Shilpika. Her husband is the academic director. Vyas ji joins shortly. He is so soft spoken that I have a hard time hearing him. 

We are offered coffee and snacks – kela chips, nankatai and mini samosas. Shonu can only have chips. We have nankatai as well. 

Then we get a tour of the school with the principal. The building is newly built, clean and spacious. We start with a tour of the grounds. There is a play area for small kids. Children as small as 2.5 years are accepted into play school. There are a couple of buildings at the rear. One is a one story building housing a game room, a ping pong room, and a library. The bigger 2 story building behind it has a large auditorium, a reading room, biology, chemistry labs, art, craft rooms etc. Outside there is a basketball court. There is also a large field with a cricket and soccer pitch. 

Next we enter the main building through a side gate. On the lower level, there are KG and classes for smaller kids. There is an audio visual room where a YouTube video is playing for older kids. A flight of stairs and more classrooms – 3-7. Some of the kids wish us good morning. More stairs. Classes 8, 9, 10. Math lesson in progress. The kids from the AV room are back here. 

A large atrium with another staircase. A music room, a martial arts room, a dance room, a counseling room. Everything looks amazing, but a little too spotless. We haven't seen any kids so far in these extracurricular rooms. Back on the ground level, we give our impressions with Vyas ji and compliment the principal. Take a photo and then our leave. 

Special fare for Mandsaur visitors - paneer masala, mix veg curry and dal for lunch.  It is simple but enjoyable. Followed by the inevitable food coma and nap.

By the time we wake up, Mandsaur folks are here. Vinod ji, Lokesh (a relative or friend) and Kamakshi are in the front room. Rama bhabhi and Meenu are having a nap in the middle room. 

After a while Aunty also wakes up and we chat with Vinod ji. His father, a freedom fighter, was associated with Vinoba Bhave. He too joined the movement for land rights and it shaped his life. He retired from LIC a year ago. He started his career as a civil engineer, did farming in his village, and then worked in insurance. His job was to explain how insurance works to villagers and he sold policies to people from his village. He led an honest life and is proud of the impact of his work. He never rejected any claims. He asks about my work. I tell him I was trained as an electronics engineer but never worked in the field, finding that I liked computers instead. 

He mentions he was born in the village and remains connected to it. I mention my family history of migration from the south to Karachi and then the forced displacement back to Mumbai. How our roots are shallow and ever changing. How our family history is one of migration. We are *musafirs* – travelers. He is reminded of a story he read on WhatsApp about how as children, we build castles of sand, competing to build bigger ones than others, which are ultimately abandoned and broken when we are called from our homes in the evening. In this way, life too is like a game, where we play with each other, building castles in the sand of varying sizes, until we are called to that great abode in the sky. The moral is that Life isn't merely about acquiring possessions, but about how we play the great game. He is somewhat of a philosopher. 

He spends retired life following a schedule. He walks 5km every day, meets with his ex colleagues, reads literature, and about Vinoba Bhave and his movement. He drinks just one cup of tea a day and has one meal a day for weight control – he had a foot injury from which he has just recovered. Lokesh is a farmer. He plants soybean, methi, pulses. 

After chai, him and Lokesh take our leave and return to Mandsaur. 

Aunty has call at 4:30 so everyone moves to the inner rooms. I also get some work done. 

Akshay delivers samosas and Rama bhabhi has brought gulab jamun. The samosa is flaky crusted and has a sweet and spicy filling. It is heavy. Shonu avoids since it isn't home made. She has plum cake. Rama bhabhi serves us heated gulab jamun. It is soft and not overly sweet. It is so good I have 4 and Shonu also has 3. Aunty also has 2-3. 

Work is resumed. Uttara and her son visit later. She is a Maharashtrian who is fond of cooking. Very friendly, almost overly so. Her son is in 10th grade. He has taken PCM - physics, chemistry and math in 11th. He wants to be either a scientist or a CA. A curious dichotomy. Appa gives him a lecture on the process of becoming a CA and then a CS – company secretary. I ask him what his favorite subject is. Physics. I suggest reading outside the syllabus. Feynman lectures are a good start. Shashi didi and Surabhi also wander over. The girl goes over to our room where Shonu and Kamakshi are playing carrom. Shashi didi has health problems. A swollen leg. 

The samosa and gulab jamuns were heavy so skip dinner. Just have a little rice and yogurt. 

Back to work. Take a call at 11:15 to provide reference to my ex-boss. Then standup call at 11:30. Work till 12:30 and call it a night. 

#### July 23, 2025


Filter coffee and chapati upma for breakfast. 

Pandya house for lunch. Om Prakash takes us – me, Appa, Kamakshi and Rama bhabhi in the car. The others to follow later in auto. First we halt briefly at Om Prakash's home, which is right behind Pandya ji's shop. It is a modest, spartan home with a bare front room. A plaque by the entrance reads "Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana". A motorcycle is parked in the living room. There is a TV on the wall, a cot and 4 plastic chairs. The walls are bare and painted in a different era. He takes us through an inner room which doubles as a bedroom and kitchen, to stairs that lead to an upper story under construction. He is building two additional rooms and a bathroom. There is a power line right above the house and a stay wire from a nearby electric pole that runs along the stairs. For living in such a modest place, he is remarkably cheerful. 

His brothers live in the homes next door. We take leave and go to Pandya ji's home. Vishal greets us with his little boy, Triyash. He is 11 months old. He will turn one on 12th August. He is cute and chubby and gives me a handshake. 

Pandya ji's wife, his brother Sunil's wife, Khushi greet us. Akshay walks in a little later with Shonu. They have come on his scooter and brought the gift bag. Amma, Meenu and Aunty arrive in auto. We give Triyash the toy we got. A colorful steering wheel with many buttons that produce different sounds. He grasps quickly that turning the wheel and the gear produces sounds. He is moving both like a little driver. I ask Shonu to sit next to him. Shonu feigns shyness. I accompany her to bolster her confidence. Then Amma and Appa come over. The little crowd proves too much for the kid and he retreats to his father. We give him space and only Shonu remains. He feels more at ease and is happily playing with the toy, occasionally trying to pull of Shonu's glasses, giving her handshakes and making cute sounds. I ask about his  nickname. Triyu. 

Lunch is served. Bhindi, aloo curry, fali, roti, kheer, besan ka laddoo, barfi, sev mixture with peanut! Alarm bells ring. Akshay asks us what items Shonu can have. Obviously not sev. Sweets other than kheer are also out. Everything else is taste tested. We tell them about the severity of her allergy. Not sure they fully understand. If they had they wouldn't have served us peanut sev. Nothing happens and Shonu is able to eat. 

After lunch, a cake is produced and cut for Meenu's birthday. It is a plain cake but tastes good. 

They won't eat until we leave. So, we don't dally and say our goodbyes. 

Afternoon nap followed by chai. Some visitors: a Muslim couple, man with white scarf wrapped around his neck, cheerful woman in burkha. Amma commits a blooper by introducing my family as being from "your" Karachi. They take it in their stride, remarking that they still have family in Karachi. Chabbra ji also makes a visit with a nephew or someone in tow to wish Meenu happy birthday. The mandatory photos for social media are taken. He sounds much louder than he did in his shop. He still appears cross that we didn't take up his offer for a meal. 

Uttara, who we have heard much about from Amma, comes with her son, Chinmay Joshi, the reticent aspiring scientist/CA. She had made the puran poli we had on the day we arrived. Those were pretty good. She has brought home made sabudana Vada and dahi Vada. Sabudana Vada is too hard on outside although soft on inside. Dahi Vada is soft. Though it looks undercooked, it tastes fine. On a second helping, she sprinkles red chili powder without asking which I have to remove with the spoon. Still I get a little and it is hot enough to create a burning feeling in the stomach. 

A second cake – plain chocolate – is cut for another private birthday celebration for Meenu. An admirer has written a fawning poem about Meenu which Kamakshi reads out to *wah wahs*. Meenu will leave by 11:45 by train. The first batch to depart as Appa later puts it. 

#### July 24, 2025

Wake up at 7. Kamakshi and Rama bhabhi leave at 8. The second batch. We have breakfast of semiya upma. Om Prakash turns up at 9:15. Vijay and his wife visit a little later. He has brought *jalebi* which we take, not wanting to hurt his feelings. We are happy to see them. He is usually the first face we see when we alight the train at Ratlam. He shows us some video of water connections he has got done. We depart at 10, the third batch to leave. 

No rain. Fill up gas worth Rs 3000. The roads are good. Distance to airport is 135km or 84 miles. At some point he gets on to an expressway. This is a 4 lane road. Very smooth. We pass many villages and fields. The greenery is stunning. We want to listen to music. He keeps Suhana Safar with Annu Kapoor Kishore Kumar episode from YouTube I think, but the music has been cut out and there is only the background narrative. He is trigger happy when it comes to switching stations and switches to one where a short story narration is in progress. Aunty asks him to switch back. We get off the highway at Ingoriya and get onto 2 lane country roads. We pass through fields of soybean and corn and many small villages on this route. We spot many bungalows in the middle of large farms, some ridiculously opulent. One with two connected wings looks like it is from a Bollywood movie. Farming seems lucrative at least for some. The tax holiday seems misdirected. For others, it is undoubtedly bleaker as the ongoing farmer suicides bear testimony. We pass through Gautampura and Depalpur. Trash collection is non-existent. Every village has its own trash mound besides random trash strewn all over. It seems like the trash mound has become a cherished Indian institution. Just a little later, there are massive political billboards. What are they taking credit for? The trash mound? Or the pockmarked roads? The populace seems weary and resigned to the situation. I feel sorry for kids who grow up in such environments. What did they do to deserve this? At the same time, I feel that the people have no desire to improve their lot in life. *Maya* is the most damaging concept invented by Indian philosophers. The belief that the world is an illusion. As also astrological beliefs that destiny is preordained. Rather than grapple with and overcome the challenges of reality, the Indian mind retreated inwards. Then there is the abomination of caste, which forbids all but those at the base of the social pyramid from sanitation work. Caste based endogamy also prevents diversification of the gene pool and keeps the population stunted and vulnerable to diseases, and the caste ladder enables and sanctions social exploitation of those on lower rungs. These are deep rooted social problems with no easy solutions. Ambedkar's inter-caste marriages are a wonderful solution but it needs to be widespread instead of a fringe phenomenon. Caste has spread like a patina covering and shaping every aspect of society. Sanding it out will be a Herculean task requiring several generations. 

The back roads have lower speed limits, yet Om Prakash is reaching 120 at times and overtaking aggressively. I ask him to tone it down, especially because these two in the back aren't wearing seat belts. As is the norm in India, the back seat belts have been tucked into the seats. The ostrich head in the sand approach to road safety. 

As we approach Indore, the road broadens into 4 lane. Tall apartment buildings loom in the distance. Indore boasts of being the cleanest city in India. It is certainly cleaner than the villages and towns we have passed through, but not entirely trash free. 

We say goodbye to Om Prakash. Check in and clear security where they want even cables and chargers to be removed. A Ganesha idol triggers an additional check. Sit in the waiting area and have parathas made by Asha. An airline employee comes up and wants us to open our checked bags since they identified something. We go down to the gate where Aunty accompanies them outside to open the bags since she packed and knows what is where. It turns out to be AllOut, the mosquito repellent. The liquid is flammable and not allowed so she has to throw it away. 

Back on the first floor, we finish lunch. Shonu has eyed a bookstore and extracts a book from us – Days at Morisaki Bookshop. 

Flight is quick. 15 minutes after takeoff we start descent into Mumbai and land early at 5:30. 55 minutes flight time. It is raining in Mumbai. 

Domestic airport is clean and elegant. There are tiles instead of the stained carpet and phenol smell at the international terminal. I feel like this should have been the international terminal. Aunty *ghus maraos* and pulls out the bags from the belt before me. 

Uber strike is over for now so we are able to take Uber XL home. The pricing is a bit of a shock. Over Rs 1000. Must be the surge pricing due to heavy traffic. Driver is tall taciturn Maharashtrian. Lot of traffic and some rain. Reach by 7. Appa happy to see us. 

Nisha has made a shimla mirch aloo curry with coconut which is very tasty and an aloo palak which is bland. 

Poor Aunty has work today also at 8:30. 

Watch match where India has been bowled out for 330 odd and England openers are flaying our bowlers. 

#### July 25, 2025

Upma with chutney for breakfast. It is very tasty.

Raining cats and dogs. 

Binge Special Ops season 2 which has a cyberattack theme. 

Order Chineej from Stomach for lunch through Swiggy. 2 fried rice, 2 Hakka noodles, 2 special chopsuey, 2 veg manchurian. Chopsuey is fiery hot. Other stuff is mild. 

Call Shamu in evening. We will go to Mulund if the rain lets up. He mentions that Chithappa probably has a viral. Arjun also video calls Aunty later and confirms that Chithappa has malaria and advises us to not visit. 

Me and Aunty have Chineej leftovers for dinner. Appa and Shonu have thair shadam. 

Cricket is depressing. England are piling up a mountain of runs. 

#### July 26, 2025

Wake up at 8:30. Appa makes coffee for me. Dosa for breakfast. Finish Special Ops season 2. 

Nisha has made a special treat for us: chola puri and shrikhand for lunch. It is quite tasty. 

Me and Shonu go to Crossword after lunch. Aunty has forbidden more than 4 books. The AC is not working in Crossword. Shonu has found 3-4 books. I point out a book on Shahrukh Khan which has to be taken. A book on Tamil stories would also not be available there so is added. End up with 6 books for Rs4400 or $50. 

We go to Cell store downstairs to fix the problem with WiFi device not working with laptop. They have an "engineer" who is just a boy doing jugaad. He calls someone after fiddling for a while and manages to get it working on my laptop. Raju chithi and Venu Chithappa have come to visit. They arrived this morning from UK. 

Watch match. England have scored 660 odd and India are 2 down for no runs. Venu Chithappa doesn't seem to be particularly analytical about cricket. His comments are mostly flippant or wildly optimistic. He chastises me and Hari for being angry and critical in our cricket comments. To each his own. 

Nisha comes at 8 and makes rotis. Raju chithi has bought corn from downstairs and is boiling it for dinner. Venu Chithappa and the rest of us have chola and chapati. 

Accompany Venu Chithappa downstairs to Wellness. He wants to buy some medicines which are apparently a quarter of the cost here.

Watch Dilwale to escape the depressing cricket. 

Appa has a headache. Find Amritanjan for him. 

#### July 27, 2025

Wake up at 7:30. Appa makes coffee for me. He still has a headache. Ask him to lie down. 

Aunty makes cheese toast sandwich since Nisha will come late today. Aunty gets packing done. Our role in this is a purely supporting one if at all. 
Have Appa check sugar after hunting around for his kit. Aunty finds it. Sugar is normal. 142 after light breakfast. He has another nap. 

Go down to get strips for meter, lancets, and Eno. Also drop off  photo print for framing at little framing shop on the other side of the street in front of the bank. Guy named Raju. Initially says it will take a day, then agrees for same day. Rs 350. Will call me. 

Lunch is dal and beans curry with coconut. The dal is lacking salt but otherwise it is good. 

Nap till 3. Framing guy calls. Caller id shows his name as Mohammad Sayeed. Go down and pick up frame. He has done a good job. Appa likes it. Put it on his table. 

Aunty makes chai. She didn't like chai I made here. Finish packing remaining stuff. 

We take bath, first of the day for me and Shonu, second for Aunty. 

Nisha comes at 6 and makes theplas. 

Shonu and Appa watching Dilwale. Early dinner at 7:15 of leftovers from morning. 

Bid goodbye to Appa and leave at 8. Neither *kazhuveri* Uber driver nor watchman (a guy I haven't seen before) offer to load luggage and I nearly sprain my shoulder. 

Reach just before 9. At the security outside, a gentleman casually breaks the queue ahead of us. This rule breaking is embedded in Indian DNA. Go through the general security after my suggestion of going all the way to the right to the business security is ignored. We do go to the business immigration queue where the guy remarks with a smile that I left on the same date on a previous trip in 2023. A small frisson of excitement in his quotidian job. 

Go to Adani Lounge. Shonu and Aunty have coke. I have a sprite. We have no appetite for food but people are helping themselves even though it is past dinner time. Shonu watching cricket on iPad. Jaddu and Washington are putting up a stiff resistance and nearing their hundreds. Call Appa and have a brief chat. Match ends in a draw with both of them reaching the milestone. 

Make our way to the gate at 11:40. Turns out we are early and have to wait for 15 mins. Another Guju gent tries to sneak ahead in the business queue. In the first class queue, a well heeled hale and hearty young man has a "paid porter" lug his carry on luggage. He doesn't look injured or indisposed. 

Shonu and Aunty have window seats. Mine is in the center. Seat next to me is empty. Get a good night's rest after takeoff. The bed makes a world of difference. 

#### July 28, 2025

Wake up after 7 hours sleep feeling refreshed. A breakfast is served of OJ, bitter and lukewarm filter coffee, fruit, strawberry yogurt, dry idli, mini uthappam, semiya upma which is just nibbled at. They don't know how to make Indian food. Listening to "Anti-Jetlag" album. Very relaxing. Beautiful sunrise on the horizon to my right. 

Struck by the contrast between India and Switzerland, which are at extremes on the spectrum of tidiness and order. India is by far the more interesting place, with its staggering cultural and geographical diversity and deep history. What would an India with a Swiss mindset for cleanliness look like? Is that even possible or is there something intrinsically chaotic about the Indian mind that manifests in external chaos? Would infusing a strain of order fundamentally alter the quality of being Indian? I don't think so. Furthermore, this might be true for humans but not for robots. Robots might hold the key to a cleaner, more orderly India with its marvelous, mad creativity left intact. And robots might hold the key to the final emancipation of the lowest rungs of Indian society, who have traditionally had  sanitation duties dumped on them. Only robots could clean at a rate faster than our prodigious ability to litter and pollute. 

People are the principal reason drawing us to India year after year. Indians have by and large retained a measure of innocence and community that the West seems to have lost with runaway economic progress and its resultant atomization of society. IST, or our notorious lack of punctuality, can be viewed as a flaw, but also as a pushback against the slavery of time. To march to our own beat. 

What do India, Pakistan, China (Tibet), Nepal, Bhutan share in common? The Himalayas. The greatest mountain range on Earth. 

Land to rain in Zurich. Stopover of 6 hours. Head straight to Swiss lounge. Have a light breakfast of muesli, strawberry yogurt, baked beans and cappuccino. Take a mini nap. Aunty does some work. Shonu has a cold. She is drinking a lot of tea and reading Shahrukh Khan book. Get a snack of chips and hummus. Pretty good. 

LX40 back to LAX. Lunch meal has Baked eggplant with feta cream, za'atar and wild herb salad, whole grain penne with ratatouille sauce, cream cheese and toasted pine nut, selection of cheeses from the canton of Ticino and shortcrust tartlet with pistachio cream and raspberry gel for dessert. This is much better than the sad Indian fare. Most of this poor Shonu can't have due to pine nuts or walnuts. The crew give her some alternative choices. 

Watching a Korean movie 4 PM about a couple who move to the countryside from Seoul, only to have their life disrupted by a psychotic neighbor who visits them daily at 4PM. Has a very dark ending and I wish I hadn't seen it. 

Scientific discovery is a process of simultaneously zooming in and zooming out, of peering into the atom's heart while bathing in galactic splendor, squinting to see the very near while opening wide to see the very far, holding the microcosm and the macrocosm in a single frame, the dance between the microscope and the telescope, the quark and the Virgo supercluster. 

"Arrival meal" is lemon and basil ravioli with cream sauce, spinach and marinated tomatoes served with a fruit salad. Middling fare. Not as tasty as the previous meal. 

Land on time. Pavan arrives to pick up after being held up in traffic. Office traffic on the way back. Some talk about US politics, immigrants, parents and their health issues, throwaway predictions by soothsayers about how lot of people will die in the coming decade, weather patterns, etc. He is kind enough to get us home cooked food by Sireesha after dropping us off and then makes another trip to get us basic groceries. All on a working day. Blessed to have such friends.

Drip irrigation has flopped. Tulsi is fully dried and kadipatta barely hanging on. Shonu and Aunty water. We all take bath, have food brought by Pavan, call India and call it a night.
