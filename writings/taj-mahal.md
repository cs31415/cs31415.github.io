### Taj Mahal - Requiem From a Dream

It shimmers in the distant haze beyond the banks of the Yamuna, rising above its pedestrian surroundings like a white dream, an El Dorado, the stuff of legend. Smoke rises from near it. Presumably from the flames of envy that it’s mortifying surroundings must relentlessly be consumed by. It is the rarest of the rare 24 carat diamonds on display in an unrelenting museum of garbage. The sneak preview from the Agra fort offers a tantalizing prelude to the mystic grandeur that suspensefully awaits.

The day of the visit is sullied early enough by pestilential touts determined to sell you a slice of the monument in some shape or form and a truly bizzare government rule that charges Pakistanis and Bangladeshis less than people born on Indian soil for the privilege of entering the monument grounds. A short bus hop follows during which the driver earns a fast buck through the timeless trick of lack of change. A brief walk in the company of touts and nonchalant buffaloes leads to the entrance where one is whisked through promptly enough, almost disappointingly quickly, to the hallowed grounds.

A brief walk leads to a massive sandstone gate whose gargantuan proportions offer a clue to the priceless structure it zealously guards. Entering it with bated breath, the eyes encounter a wall of black darkness from which the Taj emerges into view as your eyes adjust to the light, dreamlike, framed by an ornate gate, just like the millions of cliched and ad nauseam photos one has seen of it, yet quite unlike any structure one has ever seen before and will possibly ever see.

A grief-torn emperor’s immortal poem to a beloved wife snatched away too soon by the gnarly fingers of Death, a soul-piercing wail that transcends the gulfs of time and bestows space with capabilities it never had, the origins of the Taj are immeasurably tragic. A structure that is as impossibly beautiful as it is perfectly proportioned, the Taj grows on you as you get nearer, luring you in like Odysseus was by the Sirens, filling your entire visual field with the brilliance of its sublime and timeless aura, overpowering you with its sheer physical dimensions. It is a veritable mountain of marble that absorbs all the surrounding apathetic muck, decay and despair and retransmits it as a million watt soul-warming radiance to bask in. One can’t help but marvel at the skill, genius and sacrifice of the artisans and architects all driven by the timeless love and incalculable loss of an emperor still radiating outwards into space at the speed of light with the Taj as it’s epicenter.

It is possibly the grandest possession in India’s showcase and the undeservedness of Agra as it’s setting somehow only enhances its mythical stature. That people come to see the Taj despite Agra. That’s how great it is.
