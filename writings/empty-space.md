### Empty Space

This question occurred to me when listening to a [TED-Ed podcast](http://jabbercast.com/episodes/3980991). Can the space between the atomic nucleus and the furthest electron be considered vacuum? Since all it has are a handful of electrons. Google directed me to the following [reddit thread](https://m.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1u8ood/what_is_the_empty_space_in_an_atom/), which basically says that the space isn’t technically a vacuum since it contains an electron cloud, and that the probability of finding an electron at any given point is much higher than in a true vacuum such as in deep space. Well worth a full read. There are certainly some brilliant minds on reddit. 


**Update:** It seems like even empty space as in a vacuum isn’t truly empty because of quantum fluctuations or jitters. (From Fabric of the Cosmos by Brian Greene).
