### The Very Early Universe

From Alan Guth’s profoundly fascinating book, “The Inflationary Universe”:

10<sup>-39</sup> seconds after the Big Bang, the universe was as dense “as a trillion suns jammed into the volume of a proton.” 

Oh, the absurdity. My brain is still reeling from the fatuously futile attempt to visualize this microscopic monstrosity. The conception of the universe, it seems, is an utterly inconceivable affair. All the matter on the sun, which is itself ginormous compared to the earth, multiplied by a factor of a trillion cajoled, browbeaten, pummeled into a space billions of times smaller than the period at the end of this sentence. And this piffling volume of matter allegedly was created from emptiness in an interval of time so small that 1000 trillion trillion trillion such intervals would have nonchalantly, nondescriptly passed by while you were reading this. In other words, 1000 trillion trillion trillion potential universes created in the time it took you to read this. Never have words appeared more farcically futile in conveying meaning. Never has their credibility in conveying meaning been in greater doubt.
