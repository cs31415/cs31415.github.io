### Proxima Centauri - So Near Yet So Far

Stumbled upon [TIME](http://time.com/4464833/earth-like-planet-discovered-one-star-away/?xid=homepage) article on an Earth-like planet discovered orbiting our nearest star, Proxima Centauri, a piffling 4.2 light years away. Hair throughout body stands on end.

This leads to the inevitable armchair speculation of how long it would take to send a space probe to said planet given current space technology. How far is this planet again? Just a galactic stroll at 4.2 light years away.
So,
4.2 * speed of light (distance light travels in a year)
= 4.2 * 5.879e+12 miles
= 2.3516e+13 miles
= 23,516 billion miles!!!

Thus, travel time
= 2.3516e+13 miles / s (speed of spacecraft)

What might be a realistic value for s?
Google says 24,000mph based on the Apollo mission.

That’s it? Wait, we can do [better](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/life-unbounded/the-fastest-spacecraft-ever/) it seems.

In 2018 though, a new NASA mission – Solar Probe Plus – will be launched. Designed to come as close as 8.5 solar radii to the Sun (that’s about about 5.9 million kilometers or 3.7 million miles), it will hit orbital velocities as high as 200 kilometers a second (450,000 miles an hour).

Wow. Assuming this velocity can be kept up, which probably isn’t realistic, this translates into 2.3516e+13 miles / 450,000 mph ~= 5965 years.

Somewhere, a balloon deflates silently.

Hopeful words from [NASA](https://education.jsc.nasa.gov/explorers/p4.html) pump air eagerly back into aforementioned balloon.

A nuclear thermal propulsion system could potentially be over 100 times more powerful than chemical systems of comparable weight

Using our value of 5965 years above as best case for chemical propulsion gives us ~60 years to get to our doppelgänger on Proxima Centauri and shake hands (or tentacles) with our galactic neighbors, should they exist and haven’t, in a quirk of fate, decided to take off on an interstellar jaunt just to say aloha to us, in which case we might rendezvous with them sooner than anticipated!

Assuming nuclear thermal propulsion systems become a reality, mankind’s ancient dream of visiting the stars then might no longer remain a vainglorious pipe dream.
