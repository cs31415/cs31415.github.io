### Bali

Bali. A stupefying, overpowering, mind numbing explosion of art filling every available nook and cranny, every crevice, every awe inspiring natural formation. Every house a temple. Every temple an art museum. The mind and eye beaten and bloodied into submission by the sheer unfathomable volume of high grade art peeping out from every obscure village home, worthy of gracing many a world museum. Soaring temples bathed in gushing waters with intricately detailed sculptures and no deities to worship. A marriage of an ancient Hinduism with an equally ancient pacific artistic tradition and ancestor worshipping culture whose confluence provided the most exotic subjects to the most highly refined artistic minds. Ganesha, Saraswati, Rama and Sita. Priceless art amidst a fragrant and sublimely exotic natural habitat peacefully coexisting with mediocrity in every other sphere. A raw and pristine Vedic formalism with all it’s anachronistic symbolisms being religiously, unquestioningly adhered to till the present day. A fossil of pre-Upanishadic India. A cultural coelacanth. A fascinating laboratory for historians interested in Vedic culture. An evolutionary offshoot of Vedic Hinduism that froze in time.

 

“You’ll remember me, when I hold your hand, In the fields of ‘Bali'” goes a song by Sting, or so I thought when I first heard it, only learning later, to my acute disappointment, that he meant ‘barley’, not Bali. Bali sounded so much more exotic, so much more removed from the mundane. But there are no barley fields here. Only rice paddies and terraces of a lushly verdant and overpowering beauty and placid tranquility. A throwback to a bygone era. A visual spa that instantly calms and soothes frayed nerves jangled by urban toxins.
