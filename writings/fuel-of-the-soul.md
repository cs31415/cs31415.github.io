### Fuel of the Soul

What fuels the soul?<br/>
For the soul needs fuel<br/> 
In good measure<br/>
To cover enormities of time<br/>
Some say it is youth<br/>
Some swear by love<br/>
Others are driven by ambition<br/>
Still others rest tranquil in devotion<br/>
If the soul were to run out of fuel<br/>
It would wither and die<br/>
And leave phantoms in its wake<br/>
An earth full of phantoms<br/>
Is a depressing thought<br/>
But the soul is creative<br/>
It can manufacture fuel from hope<br/>
When all is lost, hope remains<br/>
Hope, thus, is the true fuel of the soul.
