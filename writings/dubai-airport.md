### Dubai Airport

A veritable ocean of granite. American style shopping malls selling American brands fused into the transit lounges, and dominating them like garish Las Vegan casino hoardings dominating airspace around "The Strip". More granite and gleam and sparkle than you could ever hope to find in the swankiest Yankee counterparts. Elegantly bearded Sheiks in stately white robes serenely floating around like messiahs seemingly untouched by the unabashedly bold strokes of western culture with which the airport is painted and reverberates, and yet controlling the whole shimmering gaudy extravaganza from their high tech tents. In comparison, American airports seem like proverbial poor country cousins.

Diehard shopaholics and deal maniacs slipping and tripping in their own drool as they try to lap up the many coruscating riches on offer. Departure gates seem like an apologetic afterthought in this setup. In summation, Dubai airport has a very simple yet profound message for the world - "Do Buy"!
