#### Day 1: August 31 2024:

Going to Arvind house in Frazier Park today. VCAS stargazing night there as well at Chuchupate which we will go to. Plan to return after lunch tomorrow. 

Stopped at Shell to get chips and chocolate. Moderate traffic en route. Maps routed through Balboa Blvd as usual. Listening to Shonu and Kamini's latest album with Ken. It's hot en route. 99 degrees. Is it going to be hot in Frazier Park?

Reach at 1:15. Took about 1 hour 15 minutes. It is hot here. 90 degrees. A delicious lunch of *muli sambhar*, potato curry and *avial* made by Nisha. Chips and *papad*. Sweet potato *halwa* made by Kamini for dessert. Food coma induced post-lunch nap. 

Wake up after an hours nap at around 5. Have oatmilk and jaggery chai (Arvind special) and *sev* toast on the balcony. Shonu sings a couple of songs on Dan's guitar – a *chota khyal* and a *Dilwale* song. 

Leave for Chuchupate which is only 10 minutes away at 6:40ish. Nisha joins us. We arrive just before 7. Lot of telescopes and cars in parking lot. We manage to bumble through telescope setup. We have brought a folding bench which is useful. It is a peaceful spot with nothing but the mountains around us in the far distance. Sunset is at 7:22, but twilight lasts for more than an hour. We walk around and meet the same guy (Dennis), who helped us setup our telescope at Moorpark college. Generally the people aren't very gregarious. They're busy setting up their own telescopes. It only starts to get dark at around 8:30. We can spot the Big Dipper, Arcturus, Vega and  Cassiopeia and a couple of satellites. Fail to spot Saturn. But we do see the Milky Way bands, though they are hazy. It is an amazing sight – a closeup of a spiral galaxy in plain sight. What's more, we're seeing the galaxy from the inside, a side on view. The angle made by the band with the horizon is the angle of the solar system's plane with the galactic plane – about 60 degrees. After a while of serene stargazing we head back in pitch darkness at 9, with only fog lights to avoid throwing off the others' night vision. 

Have *ajwain paratha* and yogurt for dinner though I am very full from the heavy lunch. Chat for a while and turn in around 11:25. Kamini has made Nisha get the big fan from upstairs since she is feeling hot and the fans in the room aren't enough for her. 


#### Day 2: 1st September 2024:

Wake up at 7:30 after sound nights sleep. Arvind is upstairs making corn upma. Have chai with both of them and Kamini on balcony. It is already getting hot. Shonu joins shortly. 

Last night's stargazing was a way of reconnecting to the universe. Modern city and suburban dwellers have lost touch with the earth, the universe and their rhythms which the ancients were intimately familiar with. 

Sat for meditation session with Arvind at 11. There were 6-7 others. Started with three phase deep breathing done lying down for about 10 minutes - inhale through stomach, inhale through chest and exhale. 108 time chanting of *Om Aim Shreem* while manifesting abundance. Culminated in chanting to a gong beat. Followed by an *alaap* by Kamini and then sharing experiences, problems or reactions. Ended at 12:30. Felt completely relaxed. 

Lunch at Red Dot. Arvind drove everyone in Chevy electric car. Very comfortable and quiet. We had pre-ordered at 11. Protein burrito and ancient grains *Khichri* for Arvind and Nisha, tofu curry in coconut gravy and rice for Shonu and veggie stir fry lo mein for us. Also ordered *pakodas* for all of us. We arrived at 12:40 and food arrived starting at 1. Red Dot is notorious for slow service. One party sitting next to us before we came still hadn't gotten their food by the time we left – they clearly didn't pre-order. The food though was excellent. The chef(s) seem to be food artists and passionate about different cuisines and the care they take shows in the quality. Came back for a mandatory nap. 

Slept like knocked out boxers till 4:30. Left for Punjabi Dhaba in Bakersfield after bidding goodbye. Reached in 30 minutes. It is a hole in the wall place in the back of a gas station. Nothing more than a mobile food truck converted into a permanent establishment, with a very basic adjoining room, thankfully air conditioned, to have food in house. Cash only or Zelle payment.

Ordered *mattar paneer* and *Punjabi kadhi* to go. Bakersfield was even hotter than Frazier Park. Felt sorry for the staff working inside the food truck. 

Had a pleasant but long drive back and reached at 7:30. Overall, enjoyed the visit. It was like a mini-retreat.
