#### Day 1: 21st March 2025:

Heathrow fire scare in morning. Cereal breakfast. Call with boss for knowledge transfer. Pavan drops at airport. George has come along. Shonu has $30 Starbucks card and gets oat milk matcha and chips for $12. Thriftiness is not one of her virtues. Service is exhilaratingly slow. Are they naturally this slow or did they practice? 

Flight shows on time. Leaves 45 mins late. We are backbenchers. Old British uncle next to me. Friendly but not talkative. Kindred spirit. Dinner is simple but good. Paneer palak, makhani dal, rice, bread. Crackers and cheese. Chocolate mousse. Fluffy and delicious. Watch [Sam Bahadur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bahadur_(film)) Hindi movie. Very well made with standout performance by Vicky Kaushal who becomes the character – changing his way of standing, walking and his whole demeanor to depict a no-nonsense army chief. Stop watching Phone Bhoot almost as soon as it starts. That atrocious it is. Nap for 4-5 hours. 

#### Day 2: 22nd March 2025:

Watch [Holiday - A soldier is never off duty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday:_A_Soldier_Is_Never_Off_Duty), an Akshay Kumar thriller. Not that well made but slightly more watchable. A sad breakfast of upma, sambhar, wadai is served. Arrive in London at 10:45am. Rough landing. Cute kids one of them laughing in delight at the landing and repeating "Get down". Must be 2 years old. 

Take Uber to Residence inn Kensington. Ride is a Volkswagen EV driven by an African on the phone. No chance for conversation. Temperatures are similar to  Simi Valley. Cloudy like Ohio. Surprisingly sparse trees given how much it rains. 

Homemade puff samosa for lunch after freshening up. Shonu is watching IPL opening ceremony with Shahrukh Khan giving a speech. Followed by KKR vs RCB match which KKR loses. Afternoon nap later wake up at 4:30. Head to Tesco supermarket next door leaving Shonu sleeping. Get some groceries. Tesco is like Vons and Walmart mashed together. Get strawberries, grapes, cheese, butter, bread, water, hot cross buns,tomato, cucumbers, Ashoka dal makhni, rice, mini naan, mocha sachets, yogurt. Vidya calls Kamini while in Tesco to congratulate for the album and article. Get back, make mocha 1 by 3. Shonu is watching Minions on TV. Rice, dal, yogurt for dinner. Listening to [Echoes of the East](https://open.spotify.com/album/1ZoCjhpJ85nHtRUjAxqRfs?si=quHFkKyDSM-34mF9Nyi7Ug) album by Shonu and Kamini which has just released. Have heard it before but not the final album cut. 

#### Day 3: 23rd March 2025:

![Kensington Palace](../../../img/kensington-palace.jpg)
<span class="credit">Kensington Palace</span>

All of us woke up at 2am due to jet lag. Shonu and Aunty ji wanted to play some game on phone. Made them lie down. Shonu was soon snoring. Aunty ji woke up at 6:30 and got ready. I woke up at 7 and was ready by 7:30. Arvind called Aunty ji to wish Shonu but she was sound asleep. She was woken up and dragged down for breakfast. 

Breakfast was well stocked. Baked beans, hash brown,  toast, granola cereal, fruits with strawberry yogurt. Cappuccino for us and tea for Shonu. The staff in the cafe were mostly Indian. Probably owned by a Gujju. 

Went back to room for Shonu to get ready. Then walked to Holland Road bus stop L for 9 bus to Kensington palace. Got into 28 bus which was also going there. Paid through Apple Pay by tapping phone. Sat on upper deck. Got down after a couple of stops, prematurely it turns out. It was good in a way because we got to walk and see the sights and sounds on the way. Many people were walking though it was a Sunday morning. It was slightly chilly but tolerable. Saw a few runners. Reached Kensington palace grounds after 10-15 minutes. Grounds are expansive and well manicured. Lots of people walking, kids playing soccer, dogs being walked, some people running. No sign of cricket so far. 

Kensington palace is the official London residence of the Prince and Princess of Wales besides other Dukes and Duchesses. An ornate gate is the first halt. Then walk through to the castle entrance and beyond. A statue of Victoria guards the entrance. She was born here. Later, a crow perches itself atop the former empress of the world, and tries to draw attention to itself. Can't find a better soapbox. 

There is a large pond opposite the statue with swans and ducks.  A small black bird with a white beak is honking loudly. Visit the Diana memorial next door which has some very pretty flowers and a statue of Diana with the princes William and Harry. Walk some more and sit for a few minutes on a bench outside the Orangery restaurant. We have a booking at 1 for high tea. 

Decide to take a tour of the palace. They make me wear my backpack on the front which is stupid. We get the audio visual guide. First go through the Queen's state apartments where Mary II lived. We go up an ornate red carpeted staircase to the state room where the queen entertained guests, a closet, a dining room, drawing room, private chambers, a bedroom, a display of royal attire, king's state rooms which are far more opulent. These include a presence chamber with a throne where George II received visitors, lavish cupola room, drawing room and gallery with impressively sized paintings. End of tour. The trouble with these tours and museums in general is that they quickly get overwhelming. 

Next stop: high tea at [Orangery](https://www.hrp.org.uk/kensington-palace/visit/the-orangery-restaurant/) for Shonu's birthday. We choose earl grey and a berry orange tea. Both are delicate and richly flavored. A set menu is brought on a 3 tier serving tray. The top tier has chocolate financier, lemon tart, blueberry and orange shortbread, and raspberry Victoria sponge. The middle tier has traditional scones. The bottom tier has finger sandwiches, chickpea spinach wrap and carrot hummus crouton. Everything is delicately flavored though some items are too sweet. The portions are tiny but the variety and experience compensate. 

We walk back along Kensington High Street which is busy with scores of shops and foot traffic, stopping at a Whole Foods to pick up broccoli cheddar soup and focaccia for dinner. Also stop at a Zurich chocolate shop to pick up some chocolate pieces. 

Afternoon nap time till 5:30. Jet lag still being overcome. Then dinner at 7:30. Call Appa and Ratlam on video call for cake cutting. Chat for some time about books, lessons from them, what we liked and applied from them, life highlights etc. 

#### Day 4: 24th March 2025:

![Westminster Abbey](../../../img/westminster-abbey.jpg)
<span class="credit">Westminster Abbey</span>


15 minute walk to Earl's Court station. It is bitingly cold – 42 F. Take Eastbound District line to Westminster. Takes about 10-15 mins. 

Big Ben pops up as soon as we exit the station. Take a few snaps. Cross the street and walk onto the Westminster bridge. Then walk back towards the Parliamentary association building. Westminster Abbey, an old church is across the road. We have to buy timed tickets and the next slot is 12-12:30. We get coffee at a hut run by a Bangladeshi and enter a gift shop to escape the cold. Shonu spots Paddington bear and gets him. 

It is a 20 minute walk to Buckingham palace where there is a changing of guard ceremony at 11. We have to walk through a park. Some beautiful cherry blossom trees in there. Many ducks. There is a crowd near the palace gates and fence and lining the paths leading to them. It is almost impossible to squeeze through to get a good view. We hang around near a gate and gradually get close enough to it to get a side view by pointing our phones inside the gate. There are guards marching here and there. The whole thing seems overrated and boring and it is very chaotic for spectators. We hang around for a few minutes and then make a hasty exit back to Westminster Abbey where we have tickets for 12:30. 

Westminster Abbey. Beautiful architecture. Artists and poet corners. Many famous personalities are buried here - artists, poets, kings, queens, politicians, soldiers. Special exhibit - climb 108 steps. No photos allowed- aunty insists on taking saying Britishers took our entire country without permission. After tour, Home made Sandwich and grapes for lunch. 

![Greenwich](../../../img/greenwich.jpg)
<span class="credit">Greenwich</span>

Thames river cruise to Greenwich. Toasty and nice, clean restrooms and lets us rest our tired feet. Shonu buys chips, juice and pretzels. We all share. Walk and steep climb to the observatory which is closed although website says it closes at 5:00 and we are there at 4:30. However a nice staff points out the prime meridian line that we can see and stand on from outside. Stand on Prime Meridian for some photos.

District line back from Westminster to West Kensington. Tesco on way back. Veg tikka masala rice, cucumber raita and chips dinner. Cake for dessert. 

#### Day 5: 25th March 2025:

![Cambridge](../../../img/cambridge.jpg)
<span class="credit">Cambridge</span>

Wake up at 6:45. Ready by 7:30. These two wake up late. Aunty ji ready by 8. Shonu brushes and comes down for breakfast. After breakfast nap for 1 hour to recover from yesterday's strain. Then Shonu takes bath and we leave sedately at 11:30 for Cambridge. 

Walk to Earls Court station. Take Picadilly line to Kings Cross station. Kings cross station is where Raj and Simran from DDLJ meet. Shonu and Aunty ji excited and sing DDLJ songs. Kings cross is also where Harry Potter's famous 9 3/4 platform is located. North line from there to Cambridge. Have to buy tickets separately for this. Costs about £66 for all of us. Board train on platform 9 but we are told by an attendant that this is a slow train and the one on platform 10 is a fast train direct to Cambridge with no stops. Run to platform 10 and just manage to catch it in time. DDLJ vibes. 

Train moves very fast and we are out of the city soon. Countryside turns green and brown with brick houses  or ugly warehouses dotting the tracks. Mostly flat terrain with low hills looming in the distance. This is no Switzerland. The underbelly is not pretty to look at. 

Reach Cambridge at about 1:15. A tout accosts us outside selling tickets for punting – a boat ride on the Cam river. Initially skeptical, we are ultimately sold by his smooth talking. He tells us his last tour is at 2:30 and that it's a quiet day so they are not doing any tours after that. He slashes prices for us and even offers us a free taxi to the location. We go along even though we had booked a free walking tour at 2. 

When we reach the dock, we are too early so we walk around and then go to a nearby Cafe – Bean Theory. Order couple of brownies which are vegan and nut free. Shonu gets a chai latte and I get a lady earl gray tea. Brownie is luscious. Tea is served in a humongous orange cup with a strainer but has rich flavor. Shonu reports approvingly of her chai latte as well. They are kindred spirits because they have named a plant "Stan." They also have a photo wall with many photos of dogs on it.

The punting vehicle is a low, flat bottom boat where we have to sit in a reclined position with feet flat on the floor. Another Azerbaijani couple with a young girl about 3-4 years old sit opposite us and there is another couple with a cute young infant behind us. A young student serves as our coxswain and guide. He is quite informative and amusing and points out various colleges and bridges along the river. Darwin's college where Charles Darwin stayed, Queens college, Kings college with the chapel and Gibbs Building which inspired the design of the White House, Trinity college attended by Newton, Hawking, Crick and Watson, Thomson, Rutherford, Neils Bohr, an ugly building called the car park, the bridge of sighs, the wishing tree, etc. He informs us that a college here is a small building where scholars have their quarters and is meant for intimate, supervised study whereas lectures are held in large halls in other buildings in the university. The most prestigious colleges are the ones with the most money and Trinity has an endowment of 2 billion pounds. 

Walk around after the ride. See Kings college chapel and Gibbs Building (which inspired the design of White House), Trinity college halls, walk around the narrow alleyways. Reach a lane lined with shops. Cambridge bookstore beckons. I have to answer natures call and ask around in a gelato shop. They have a toilet. But we have to make a purchase. So Shonu gets gelato unexpectedly in the bargain. Walk along the shop lined street for a while, pausing for snaps now and then of impressive towers. Then head to Tiffin food truck – a restaurant despite the name – a few minutes away. 

It has an eccentric vibe with AI generated pictures on the walls. We have masala dosa. Shonu has sambar Vada and fries. Decent though I've had better. 

Walk back to Cambridge station. Takes about 20 minutes. Board slow train. Write this journal on the way while nodding off occasionally. 

At Kings Cross station, there is a Harry Potter's 9 3/4 station shop where Shonu gets some pics. Stand in a queue to get another pic with props but this time Shonu has to answer nature's call so we have to exit just before our turn. 

Get supplies from Tesco on the way back. Shonu has soup and bread. Aunty ji has yogurt, granola and banana. I have yogurt and blueberries with chocolate caramel ice cream for dessert. 

#### Day 6: 26th March 2025:

![Lords](../../../img/lords.jpg)
<span class="credit">Lords</span>

Wake up at 6:30. Aunty ji ready by 8. Goes down for breakfast and to meet her ex-office colleague Melinda. Shonu ready by 8:45 and both of us descend for breakfast. Meet her husband, Rick. Nice guy who reminds me of a camera reviewer Kai Wong. He asks about cricket and I give him some basics. When he asks about franchise cricket, I anoint Shonu as the expert and smartly exit to replenish. They just arrived yesterday and are planning to do Buckingham palace change of guard and borough market today. Tomorrow they visit Tower of London just like us. 

We exit and take Uber to Lords where we have a tour at 10:30. We are directed to a museum with a cornucopia of treasures – the Ashes urn, the Prudential World Cup, Ganguly's famous T-shirt, bats belonging to Ranjitsinghji, Bradman, Sangakkara, WG Grace among others. A gentleman then gives us an introduction and asks between which countries the first international cricket match was played. Shonu answers pat – USA vs Canada. He is impressed. An Aussie kid wearing a baggy green about Shonu's age looks shocked. Our host narrates the story of the Ashes. The game was a one off between Australia and England which was later recognized as a test match. England were set a target of 85 to win in the final innings and collapsed from 59-2 to 77 all out. The English press were scathing in their review and mourned the death of English cricket, cremating the body and shipping the ashes off to Australia. It was all a big joke. 

Next stop: long room from where we get our first glimpse of the hallowed turf. An iconic location where India's greatest sporting moment was recorded in 1983. It scarcely seems believable. This is where the MCC members sit and players walk through on their way to and from the ground to the dressing rooms. There are huge portraits on the wall – Brian Lara, Kapil Dev, Dilip Vengsarkar. Apparently, the artist was miffed at Vengsarkar for some reason because his portrait showed a set of stumps with the bail dislodged, and depicted him with an annoyed expression. Both Indian players are also shown wearing formal shoes with their cricketing whites, which creates an odd aesthetic. 

Next we trudge into the visitors change room. It is quite spartan and bathrooms and showers are located outside unlike modern change rooms. Our guide informs us that this is because this is an old building and building codes prevent modifications to historic structures. The balcony is very small – this is where Ganguly took off his shirt. The honors boards are here as well. Players scoring centuries or taking 5 wickets in an innings get to have their names inscribed in gold leaf here. The guide mentions that the names missing from this board are as interesting as the ones on it. No Tendulkar, Warne, Kohli. But Ajit Agarkar, the Bombay Duck, who scored five ducks in a row on a tour of Australia, manages to hustle his way in, by scoring 109*.

The home change room I find less interesting. Since England play here more than other teams, they have more opportunities to get on the board.  

Now we exit the building and walk around, walking past the practice area. Here we are told is where overarm bowling started, and it was a woman who invented it, finding it difficult to bend down in her dress to bowl underarm. We have women to thank for overarm bowling then. Thus enlightened and the men in the party suitably chastened, we take an elevator to the media center. This is a modern, some say incongruous, addition to the ground. A panoramic view of the ground can be seen behind a massive glass wall. This is the view the commentators and press get. Its not a bad one.  

We are then taken to the stands adjacent to the turf. This is the only place we are allowed to take videos. The ground appears small – as small as the Nassau County stadium we went to in New York. It has a capacity of just 33,000.

We finally exit to a gift shop, which is a disappointment. They don't even have cricket bats here, and the stuff they do have is richly priced. 

![Sherlock Holmes Museum](../../../img/sherlock-holmes-museum.jpg)
<span class="credit">Sherlock Holmes Museum</span>

Exiting the ground, we walk to 221B Baker street to visit the Sherlock Holmes museum. A 15-20 minute walk. It is a 3 or 4 story apartment full of Victorian era artifacts arranged to resemble Sherlock Holmes' living quarters. Very interesting though it seems more cramped than what I had imagined. Buy 3 Sherlock themed puzzle books from the gift shop.

Take Uber to Leicester square. Nice park. Take vegan burger and  Fries from Burger King and sit on grass. I eat homemade sandwich. These two split burger and we share fries. Dry bare bone burger but peppers make it edible. Some busker singing songs that Shonu knows. She comments on his lack of singing skills. Grass is perfect.

Walk to a lane of bookstores. Cecil court. Nothing of interest. Only collectors items. Walk to Trafalgar Square, where DDLJ scene with Amrish Puri feeding pigeons shot. Take pics. Across the street there is a Waterstones book store spotted by hawkeyed Shonu. Buy 8 books despite concerns about luggage space. Uber to Borough market. Strawberries in chocolate – finished in all of 2 mins. Popular on social media and recommended by Aunty's teammate. 

Walk to Monument underground station. Take district line back to Earl's court. Mac n cheese for dinner and cake for dessert. 

#### Day 7: 27th March 2025:

![Tower of London](../../../img/tower-of-london.jpg)
<span class="credit">Tower of London</span>


Tower of London at 9:30. Go with Melinda and Rick. Walk with them to Earl's Court station. Along the way, we discuss what we did yesterday. We mention our book haul. Rick, who is an English major, also seems to be a book lover. He mentions that the covers on British editions are more attractive than the US versions, something I had also noticed when comparing prices on Amazon while at Waterstones. We take district line to Tower Hill station. The station is crowded with office commuters. Mumbai vibes. We somehow manage to squeeze into the train. Aunty ji exclaims that it is so crowded we don't have to hold on. An elderly British lady remarks that she had a similar experience in Sri Lanka. 

We take wrong turn in alighting from the station and have to backtrack. 

Tower of London is a medieval castle housing the Crown Jewels. Take the Crown Jewels tour. See Koh-i-noor and Cullinan diamonds which are set in crowns. Koh-i-noor is humongous but otherwise a touch on the dull side. A TV screen shows its journey from the Kollur mines to Persia and back to Punjab, where Duleepsingh aged 10 (no relation to the one after whom the Duleep Trophy is named) surrenders it to the British under the Treaty of Lahore after a battle loss. The Cullinan II, a cut from the world's largest diamond from South Africa, is actually more impressive, radiating fire as you view it from different angles. The Cullinan was gifted by the Transvaal government to King Edward VII as a sign of goodwill. A walkalator takes us slowly past the gem studded crowns of various kings and queens. The lighting is subdued and the music sombre. It is designed to create an air of mystique around these symbols of royalty. 

Melinda and Rick take the yeoman warder tour while we bid them goodbye and head to the White Tower. On the way we stop at another museum – the Fusilier museum housing various military artifacts such as medals of honor, arms and artillery, uniforms etc. Boring to us. 

White Tower houses various arms and armaments and knight and equine armor. There are 4 or 5 stories with 200+ steps. This would be very interesting to a student of British history but there isn't much here to hold our interest, which progressively wanes as we ascend each floor. Aunty spots an armor from Indore and Gwalior. The descent through a never ending spiral staircase brings relief. 

Exit and walk across Tower bridge to Queen's walk, a promenade along the Thames with several restaurants. It is well trafficked. Takes 25 mins. Small lunch of margherita pizza and garlic bread in Pizza Express opposite Globe theater. Portions are smaller than we are used to in the US but the taste is excellent. I accidentally key in a 4 pence tip instead of 4 pounds and the waiter, an excitable Italian, requests cash. Dollars Ok. Give him a fiver. He is happy. Dollar is still welcome here. 

![Globe Theater](../../../img/globe-theater.jpg)
<span class="credit">Globe Theater</span>

Next stop: Cymbeline performance at Sam Wanamaker playhouse, the indoor theater attached to the Globe Theater. It's 2 hrs 50 mins long. Hadn't expected this. The theater is intimate. Aunty worried about checkin and seats for flight tomorrow which would open midway through the play. There are two storeys of vertical seating – balconies overlooking the stage. Our seats are in the pit just below the stage level. The seating is rudimentary. Wooden benches with cushions but no backrest. No photos or videos allowed. 

Play starts at 2pm. One of the artists comes on stage and informs us that the actress playing Cymbeline is indisposed and an understudy is substituting for her. The musicians are seated in a section high above the stage. 

The play begins with an entrance by Earth goddess Gaia (apparently the original has Jupiter), queen Cymbeline and her husband, who has a son Cloten who is seeking to inherit the throne by marrying the queen's daughter Imogene. Curiously, the genders of the queen and king are reversed compared to the original play. Imogene is married to a commoner named Posthumus, whose gender is also flipped. Clearly, the director has some beef with the patriarchy. 

It is a tale of love, separation, suspicion, deceit, betrayal all neatly tied up in a bow at the end. There is comedy, tragedy, mixups, disguise, deception and resolution. A masala play from the 15th century with the modern director adding her own masala. 

Check in and confirm our seats during reccess. 

Walk back to Monument station. It's a long 25 minutes walk through Borough market and London bridge. Shonu tries for chocolate strawberry again but it is closed. Take district line back to Earl's court. Stop at Tesco on way back and pick up rice and naan. 

I am having a sneezing fit. Some allergy. Aunty ji makes a paneer tikka masala combining the veg tikka masala microwave dinner, paneer, old fresh fries, tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. Accompanied by naan, rice and cucumber raita. Cranberry juice and sprite cocktail mojito for aunty and Fanta for me and Shonu. A welcome change from travel fare. Last night at the hotel so aim to clean up the fridge. These two have ice cream bar for dessert. I have already had mine previously and content myself with a chocolate from the Zurich shop we got on the return walk from Kensington palace. 

#### Day 8: 28th March 2025:

Wake up late today at 6:45. Get ready after a cup of mocha. We go down at 9 for breakfast. It is much more busy and it takes a while to secure a table. Eat lighter than usual today since not much walking expected. 


Checkout by 10:45. Uber driver is a stocky though genial Kashmiri from Pakistan. He is huffing and puffing from just coming back to open the hatch. Has been here since 1983. Some small talk about the beauty of Kashmir, London traffic, driverless cars, taxes, unkept political promises. I change the conversation when he starts spouting half truths about Covid vaccine. He apparently never took one. The rest of the journey elapses in silence. 

We are early for the check in so bide time for half hour. Shonu Kamu do coloring. Enquire about upgrade but it is too expensive. After security check, during which a prickly security woman chides me for keeping my passport in my pocket during the X-ray, we pick up hot mozzarella, tomato and red pepper baguettes from Pret and ingest this while seated at the gate. 

The veg meal is only provided to Shonu and Aunty ji. I must have forgotten to request one. There is a snag there too in that they can't tell us whether the hot item – biryani – is nut-free. Poor Shonu doesn't eat it but does eat the accompanying items. Yummy sticky toffee pudding. Surprised to see clear food allergy labels and many eggless vegetarian dessert options. I give her my crackers and cheese and Aunty ji gives her her bread. I end up getting a veg Jain meal with some rice and squash curry which is Ok. 

Watched [Coat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_(film)) Hindi movie with Vivaan Shah and Sanjay Mishra. An indie movie about a low caste boy who desires a coat and works his way up through business to earn it. The story is simply told and effective. But a couple of diversions don't contribute much to the narrative. The higher caste love interest who ditches him and the random death of the mother right at the end are discordant notes. Also, the ascent from a mud hut to a proper house seems too quick and easy. The ending is also a little abrupt, jarring and poorly edited. Nevertheless, the movie has a positive social message in its depiction of how it is possible to overcome caste prejudices and rise above one's circumstances. Vivaan is convincing as the village outcaste. This role is quite a step up from the usual ensemble roles he has been essaying. Sanjay Mishra is superb as usual. 

Watching [The Monk and the Gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monk_and_the_Gun), an indie movie about democracy coming to Bhutan and the changes and disruption it brings. 

We didn't have to exchange any currency this trip for the first time. Everywhere we went credit card was accepted. All public transport accepted Apple Pay. 

Pavan gave us a ride from the airport. Chats about Vedas and positive future predictions for kumbha rashi. Kamini engages with him and I escape the conversation which is of no interest to me.

Pavan brings us hot food – daal, aloo gobi and rotis – informing us that credit for food goes to Samanvitha. Also gets us milk and bread. Very helpful since we are not in the best condition to go to the store.
