### Touching Atoms

If the atom is almost entirely empty space, then what is it that we feel when we touch a table or a rock or the keyboard I am typing this on?

What is responsible for the astonishing variety of textures that physical objects possess? Is it their molecular structure? Is that why coal feels different to the touch than diamond although they are composed of the same identical carbon atoms?

Isn’t it the internal molecular arrangement extrapolated out to human scale that we are actually “feeling”?

So for example in the case of liquid water, it feels fluid because that is the nature of the molecular arrangement – bound by weak van der Waals forces.
Whereas in the case of solid ice, the same forces are more effective at squeezing the structure together because the H<sub>2</sub>0 molecules have very little kinetic energy to counteract them.
