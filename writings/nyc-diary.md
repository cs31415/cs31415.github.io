#### Day 1: 8th June 2024:


Woke up at 5:30, had tea and got ready by 6:45. Uber came at 7. Elderly Sardarji in Camry. Spoke in English at first. Switched to Hindi after inquiring as to our origins. From Punjab. Had been here for 12 years. Asked if we were going to India. No. New York to watch India USA cricket. Some small talk about Indian population and Indian stores and restaurants in Simi Valley. Told him Shonu plays hockey and many Indians play. Wonderful. Yes, it is a sport from Punjab, he beams. 

Reach LAX around 8. Traffic is moderate. Clear security quickly. Gate is 47B. American Airlines flight 184 to JFK. Seats are in short supply at the gate which seems built for an era of smaller planes. Find separate seats, then together as a flight boards for Mexico City from an adjacent gate. A cute kid opposite us, barely a year old looks at Shonu intently. 

Have homemade burger for breakfast. Boarding starts shortly. Our seats are in the middle, towards front of the economy block. Lots of legroom thanks to premium plus seats bought by Kamini using airline miles. We got two seats together. Kamini requests the guy at the window if he would exchange with another window seat of ours. He graciously agrees with the caveat that he will reclaim his seat if it happens to be next to a crying baby or dog. We glance back to make sure he is next to neither. 

A cute baby in a bjorn and a saintly dog wend their way through to the back of the cabin. 

They have a screen with English movies only. Headphones are offered free. I start watching [Shawshank Redemption](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shawshank_redemption), but stop soon. It is a grim theme about convicts in a prison. 

How many states do we have to cross enroute to New York? 9.

> – [The Vagabond's Way](https://www.amazon.com/Vagabonds-Way-Meditations-Wanderlust-Discovery/dp/0593497457)

The genesis of this whole trip was Shonu's persistence in checking ticket availability for India vs USA game. Once the tickets were secured, the whole trip crystallized around that event. 

American flight is surprisingly decent. Didn't expect anything. Free headphones, snack box with cheese, crackers and fruit, biscuits and pretzels, beverages, friendly service are all a welcome bonus. We didn't need food since we brought our own – puff pastry samosas and sandwiches made by Kamini. We had samosa for lunch at 1:15pm.

Get some writing done. This travelogue. 

Shonu gets good views of NYC from window seat as we arrive. It looks much greener than LA. The plane loops a long way around Long Island before it prepares to land at JFK. It has been a smooth flight with a few mild bumps. It is a touch breezy when we land just before 6pm. It is sunny with a few scattered clouds. 

As we walk towards the exit, there is a giant sculpture of an apple. We take photos next to it. We take Lyft to the hotel which is in Manhattan. Bangladeshi driver in Toyota RAV-4 with EarPods mumbling inaudibly to someone, a wife or friend, in Bengali. It is a very long drive and there is a lot of traffic. Long Island is fairly rustic with unkempt grass and vegetation hiding brown brick apartments and homes, which get progressively bigger. Very reminiscent of Mumbai. I later learn these areas are Queens and Brooklyn. As we approach Manhattan Island, some sights made familiar by Hindi movies start materializing. A bridge which is not the Brooklyn bridge but looks like it frames the setting sun. The Statue of Liberty, tiny yet unmistakable in the distant sunset haze. We slither through the Hugh L Carrey tunnel to Manhattan. The iconic Manhattan skyline looms above, dominated by the World Trade Tower, symbol of unconquerable will. Xeroxed by cities the world over, this is the original silhouette. Humanity's riposte to nature's mountains. The Big Apple. The Brooklyn bridge races by to the right, the Chrysler building to the left as we pass through the city's more industrial, seedier side. Here, there are ancient buildings housing all sorts of businesses – oil, diesel, Mexican, Chinese wine traders. The Chinese are also into wine now? Is there anything they have left for the rest of the world to make?

As we turn into Manhattan, away from the freeway that circumferences it, the light grows dimmer from the shadows of giant buildings, like the floor of a rainforest. The city is alive and throbbing, cars and people pulsing through its arteries and veins. A raw human energy is palpable, as in India. 

Our hotel tower is in what seems like a slightly wider alley. We are accosted by a tout as soon as we alight from the car. He moves on when he sees we have a booking. 

We enter the lobby of the Hilton through a revolving door. Shonu squeezes into the same enclosure as me even though it says only one person at a time. 

After we check-in, we have to take an elevator. There is a touch screen on which we have to select our room number and tap our key next to a reader. This summons an elevator with no buttons that is programmed to take us to our floor. High tech. There are a number of elevators and this solves the problem of distributing load as well as security. 

On the 27th floor, there is a door to rooms 2712 & 2714. Ours is the latter room. There is a key reader next to this door but our key doesn't work. We spend 10 minutes figuring out why it doesn't work before I realize that the door isn't locked. It opens into an antechamber from which our room door is accessible. 

The room is tiny but highly functional. Every square inch of space has been utilized. Like the hotel we stayed at in Hong Kong. There is a queen bed and a pull out sofa bed. A compact bathroom. A kitchenette with microwave, toaster, fridge, sink and dishwasher. A small cupboard with hangers and a safe. 

We freshen up and head out to a nearby Target through Times Square. Towering electronic billboards adorn every building here. The whole building converted into a multicolored, flashing, strobing advertisement that changes every few seconds. What must a 10 second spot cost here? One of the screens has an ad for the T20 World Cup with Virat Kohli jumping out at us, amidst other faces that are barely recognizable. Can't escape the marketing machine that is Kohli even in the Big Apple. 

The crush of human traffic is unanticipated. Mumbai vibes. Multiple nationalities – African, Latin American, Middle Eastern, European, Indian, East Asian. The crossroads of the world. We are taken unawares by the scale of the place – the inhuman scale of the billboards and the crush and throng of humanity. There is even a gathering with Palestinian flags, though peaceful. Touts abound. One tries to *namaste* us into a city tour bus. This is Mumbai scale humanity, even Hong Kong paling in comparison. Santa Monica 3rd street no more than a village. 

We thread our way through this herd of wildebeest and reach Target. This location is different – concrete floors, stepped levels, human thrum – it feels like New York. We get some staples – soup, bread, Mac n cheese, water, chocolates. 

Back at the hotel, we have a light dinner – Mac n cheese, soup and toast – and draw the curtains on an eventful day. 



#### Day 2: 9th June 2024:


Woke up at 6:30. Brushed and went downstairs for breakfast. Got bagels, cereal, coffee, tea and condiments while HRH Shonu slumbered. 

Big game day today. India vs Pakistan. Not far from us in Nassau county international cricket stadium in Long Island. But no hope of being in person. Tickets are still available at 10k each! No thank you. I'll take my iPad in a tiny hotel room. 

iPad is installed in position with WillowTV app at 10:30. Rain has delayed start of play. Shonu insists on calling Mamaji before the game. She can be persistent. This time she had her mom's support. When I wasn't calling, mom went ahead and video called Mamaji. Mamaji has his unique way of calling the game which Shonu loves. He was wearing an India cap and in game mode. Added Appa to the call a little later. It was great fun I admit. Hari was enjoying the game in a theater with friends. Arjun was in Singapore and sleeping. They didn't pick when I called. The game started after a half hour delay. Pakistan won the toss and chose to bowl first. Bad toss to lose given the difficult drop-in wicket not to mention the rain and overcast conditions. 

Rohit started with a bang hitting Shaheen for a six in the first over. Kohli matched him by hitting an exquisite cover drive off Naseem next over. Then, disaster as he holed out to point. A needless shot I felt given that they needed to get through the initial difficult period without losing wickets. 

Next over, the heavens fell down when Rohit also perished flicking Shaheen to deep midwicket. Had they gone mad? Whose idea was it go down guns blazing?

Mamaji at this point disconnected as he felt that the video call was jinxing it. 

Pant had come in followed by Axar. This was a bizarre tactic. Suryakumar being protected by a nightwatchman in T20?

Axar had apparently come out as a pinch hitter. He did that job somewhat by hitting a six and a couple of boundaries. Pant was not his usual self and was missing most shots and living dangerously. The sticky wicket with balls not quite coming on was upsetting his timing. 

He broke the shackles in one Harris Rauf over hitting three successive boundaries. But he continued to be the cat with nine lives as he kept hitting the ball inches away from outstretched hands and giving Paki and Indian hearts a workout. 

Axar perished scoring 20. Surya and Dube came and went back with crumbs to their name. Pant rode his prodigious luck before perishing for 42. 

Pandya huffed and puffed his way to 7 off 12 and it was left to Arshdeep and Siraj to push the score close to 120. 119 all out in 19 overs. 120 to win in 20. What an abject performance knowing the nature of the wicket fully well. A strategic failure above all to be over aggressive and not aim for a reasonable score from the outset. 

It seemed like the result was a formality. 

Had leftover sandwiches, puff pastry, cheese and grapes for lunch. 

India started with Arshdeep and Siraj. They were not very tight and runs were ticking over like a clock. Bumrah for some reason was held back and his introduction in the 3rd over immediately resulted in a regulation catch spooned by Rizwan to Dube at deep fine leg which he shelled. Silent outrage. Catches like these cannot be dropped at international level. 

Barfi had tagged along and surfaced during the break. He had been lying low. 

Babar cute glided one to SKY at slip in Bumrah's next and was on his way. 26-1. Usman Khan was into the bullring for the first time in his life and looked nervous. 

He went at 57 when Axar came on, rapped plumb in front first ball. Fakhar Zaman, of whom the Pakis had high hopes, started well but was deceived by a Pandya bouncer for a smart catch by Pant. 73-3 in the 12th over. 

Bumrah's return in the 14th over was the turning point as he induced a slog and shattered Rizwan's furniture. Of all the bowlers, he picked Bumrah to slog. Not the most intelligent tactic. Their set batter was gone and the others were finding it difficult to get runs. 

Meanwhile Mom was annoyed that the day had been spent watching a losing cause instead of sightseeing and went off to sleep. Appa also went off to bed in Mumbai thinking that defeat was imminent and not wanting to miss out on sleep. 

Meanwhile, a squeeze was being stealthily applied by Pandya, Jadeja and Axar and runs were drying up. The balance was tilting slowly but ominously. Shadab holed out to a short ball from Pandya in the 16th. When Bumrah started the 19th, 21 runs were required. He got Ifthikar and only gave away 3 runs. Arshdeep had 18 to defend in the last over. A total and unexpected reversal of fortunes. 

Imad went early in the 19th caught behind by Pant. Shaheen and Naseem tried their best, with the latter hitting a couple of boundaries.  But it was too late for last-minute heroics and India scraped through by 6 runs, by the skin of their teeth. 

A totally unexpected and undeserved result. They got out of jail thanks to Bumrah and the bowlers. Pakistan were swindled in broad daylight, their fortunes in the tournament left hanging by a thread. 

By this time, Mom had woken up and was somewhat placated by the Indian win. We dressed and quickly left the hotel. 

A short 15 minute walk through 7th ave brought us to Central Park. The weather was lovely and sunny with a few clouds. Shonu cajoled her mom into a berry drink from Pret along the way. 

Central Park is a little jungle right in the middle of a city. The backdrop of skyscrapers makes it unique. No other city must be having a park of this size within it's boundaries, that too where real estate is at such a premium. The most expensive park in the world. 

It was leafy and shaded and our hike brought us some spectacular views of the skyline. We walked to *The Pond*, with a little bridge over it, sat and took in the sights from a bench for a while, and then moved on to 5th street where there was a little park with a golden statue of General Sherman, the same Civil War hero after whom the General Sherman tree in Sequoia National Park is named. Some photos later, we started walking along 5th street. There was lot of police presence and lots of fire trucks screamed their way down 5th ave towards our hotel. Reason unknown. 

5th avenue is quite upmarket with an Apple Store, Prada, Coach, Gucci, Tiffany and other outlets. There was even Trump Tower right in the middle of it all. Shonu and mom refuse to have their picture taken in front of it. There was a lovely Presbyterian church as well. 

By now, Mom was hangry so we looked for pizza. We found a Simò Pizza on W 52nd. It was a little hole in the wall place with a few barstools and benches for eating in. We ordered a *Margherita* and a *Verdura*. It came hot off the oven and tasted fresh and delicious. It was Italian style Napolitano pizza. Great find. 

Hunger abated, we trudged back to the hotel. Enroute, Shonu eyed a Van Leeuwen vegan ice cream place on 6th ave and dragged us inside. I refrained given my cough, but Shonu had a dark chocolate and Mom had cookies and cream. According to Shonu, it was a 9.8 compared to 10 for Salt and Straw in Culver City. 

Back at the hotel, we saw photos, I typed my journal and downloaded photos from camera, and we slept early. These two by 9, I at 10:30. 

#### Day 3: 10th June 2024:


Breakfast at 7 in eating area downstairs. Bagel, muffin, coffee, cereal – the usual suspects. 

5 minute walk to subway station on 50th st. We buy a Metro card and load 30 dollars on it at the kiosk. Then take the 1 downtown train to South Ferry enroute to Battery Park for the ferry to Statue of Liberty. Tickets are for 1pm but we arrive early at 11:30. There is a serpentine queue and it takes 5 minutes to find the end of it. It moves quickly and by 12 we are at the security check and board the ferry shortly after. We head to the top deck but there is only standing room. We can see the Statue of Liberty in the distance. Its scale must be impressive to be visible from this far. 

It is a short ride and within 10 minutes the statue comes clearly into view. Its scale is truly massive and it looms over the Manhattan skyline like a colossus. 

Shonu and mom are immediately hungry and stop for pretzels and lemonade from a vendor at the back of the statue. The pretzel is fresh and salty – a welcome snack. The view of the NYC skyline from here is truly magnificent. The greatest and most famous skyline in the world. To the left, Jersey City's skyline is visible, and to the right, the Brooklyn skyline – puny sidekicks. 

We walk in a clockwise direction towards the front of the statue, stopping for photos of the skyline and the statue from various angles. The statue is about as tall as a 30-40 story building. It is gigantic. The scale can only be fathomed from viewing up close. The statue's cladding is made of copper and was apparently brown when inaugurated. It has turned green due to oxidation, which in my opinion, is what makes it iconic. The statue is holding a torch in one hand, and a tablet bearing the date of American Independence in the other. We can see that there are visitors in the statue's pedestal, and some even in the crown. What view they would get of the statue itself from that vantage point is debatable. 

We also visit a museum about the statue where we learn many things. The statue was designed by a Frenchman, Bartholdi, and inaugurated on the centenary of American Independence in 1886. A birthday gift from France to the people of the United States. 

We stop at a gift store and Shonu gets some stickers, a fridge magnet, and Oreo and Brownie, tiny keychain bears dressed as Statue of Liberty. 

We take the return ferry after jostling our way to the front through the crowd, *desi* style, and reach Battery Park around 3pm. We have delicious cut mango from a Mexican vendor in the park for five dollars. Next stop is Brooklyn Bridge. 

Take R train to York and Front St in Brooklyn. From there we take B25 bus to bridge. Metro card can be used in the bus as well. Short 2 minute walk from bus stop to bridge. First went to pier. Then to Empire Fulton park where Bollywood movies like *Kal Ho Na Ho* were shot. Got panoramic views of Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges with Manhattan skyline in the background. Shonu had a meltdown and refused to pose for photos. She wanted to return to the hotel. She was probably hungry. So we found a pizza place we had passed on the way to the bridge – Juliana's pizza. It is busy so we reasoned the food must be good. 

Had large *margherita* pizza, Neapolitan style, which was excellent. Shonu is now in better spirits so we press on and decide to go to World Trade Center observation deck. 

We take the 2 train in wrong direction by mistake, then go back on 3 line one station and switch trains to take the 2 line in right direction, which is uptown. 

Walked 2 blocks from station to World Trade Center. Shonu sights a T20 World Cup fan park right outside World Trade Center. We stop and take some pics here. We later learn that Tendulkar had been here and curse our timing. 

Then we walk to One World Observatory entrance which is one block away. We see the 9/11 memorial park on the way. Two large wells bounded by a wall mark the spots where the original towers stood. The wall is engraved with the names of the victims who died that day. There are names from several  nationalities, many Indian names too. It triggers a deep sadness. What harm did they do to the terrorists? What was their fault for which they had to pay with their lives? It was an attack not on one nation, but a crime against humanity itself whose shock waves continue to reverberate. 

The new WTC tower viewed from the ground seems to extend to infinity. Its summit can't even be viewed. Bought tickets for $45 each at entrance kiosk. Elevator took us to the top at breathtaking speed – in 10 seconds flat. A video plays in the background showing a space time progression as the view rises from the bottom floor to the 102nd floor. Simultaneously, we are rising along the time axis, as shown by NYC's progress from a small village to its present day status as world capital. It is ingeniously conceived and executed. The elevator goes up so fast our ears pop. 

At the top floor, we are ushered into a theater where a movie about the many faces of NYC are shown. At the end of the movie, the screen lifts up to reveal a stunning view of the entire city from glass windows to gasps from the audience. 

![One World Observatory](../../../img/wtc-observation-deck.jpg)
<span class="credit">One World Observatory</span>

A floor above we experience 360 degree views of the city from all sides. Breathtaking. We have been transported to a plane high above mortals in the blink of an eye. There are two viewing levels here. We can't get enough of the views and hang around for night time views. We have chai coffee and Shonu has Gatorade to pass time. But she is getting irritated and wants to go back. We cajole her into staying till 8:45 when the lights come on. The night time views are even better.  

We take 1 uptown train right from inside World Trade Center. At the station, a Hispanic woman with her teenage son and 3-4 year old daughter asks us something in Spanish. Kamini has presence of mind to have her speak into Google translate. She needs to get to 72nd street and is this the right train? Kamini confirms it is after checking Google maps. The woman is grateful but doubtful and needs to be reassured once more after boarding the train. 

We reach the hotel at close to 10:30pm. A packed but satisfying day which I bookend by downloading and editing photos and writing travelogue. 

#### Day 4: 11th June 2024:

Woke up late at 8:30 today since we slept late yesterday. Got coffee from downstairs and had cheese sandwich and leftover muffins for breakfast. 

Started for Met museum of Art at 11am. This is a huge museum in Central Park. Took the B line from 6th ave and 48th St to 81st St, then M79-SBS bus to 5th ave and 79th st, followed by short walk to Met. 

The entrance is grand, with fountains and classical architecture. We already got tickets online which are $30 per person, so we walk right into an exhibit – the Egyptian one on 1st floor. They have some very old exhibits – mummies, sculptures, murals, Anubis, god of the dead, with the head of a jackal – about 4500 years old. 

We slipped into an African exhibit next, guarded by two figures with lion heads. Saw some typical tall African looking figurine before stepping back out into Egypt. Relics from tomb of Metjetji, 4500 years old. These have hieroglyphics, some of which are engraved, others are embossed. Ancient stories which were only understood 200 years ago. 

We move on to ancient China, a period following Buddhist influence. A giant mural depicting life of Buddha covers a whole wall. Busts of Bodhisatva as Maitreya, Buddha of the future, from present day Pakistan depict him with a moustache and flowing locks. 

A pair of chimeras, mythical monsters with lions head, goat body and serpent tail guard a section. 

Asian art is immediately far more intricate than the Egyptian artifacts we have seen. These were made by nameless, faceless geniuses, no less talented than the da Vincis and Michaelangelos, yet don't always get their due in a Western-centric world. They are branded as ethnic art (one of the definitions of *ethnic* in New Oxford English Dictionary is *neither Christian nor Jewish; pagan*, albeit an archaic usage), while Greek and Roman art is labeled classical. History and culture are the preserve of the powerful. 

The confluence of Indian and Chinese art and philosophy is seen in the various Buddhas and Bodhisatvas from ancient China, many of which are on larger than life scale and intricately detailed. India's roots run deep in China. I suspect that there are strong parallels between Buddhism and the Chinese philosophies of Taoism and Zen, which made Buddhism more acceptable. 

![Met Museum](../../../img/met.jpg)
<span class="credit">Met Museum</span>

We finally arrive in Ancient India on the 2nd floor. There is a lot of Buddhist art. Buddhism is not only a religion and philosophy, but also an artistic platform. Much ancient energy has been poured into depictions of the moods and inner states and life of the Buddha, and this too I think is part of the Buddhist canon as much as any scripture. 

Indian and Chinese art are of comparable intricacy. Indian might be a little more so, but the contrast with Western art is strikingly obvious. 

There is art from the Indus Valley civilization, which is simpler in form. 

There is much Buddhist art from ancient Gandhara in present day Pakistan. I find the Bodhisatva's depiction as Maitreya, future Buddha, as particularly handsome. 

There are Narisimha, Shiva Parvati, Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva – the Hindu trinity – from 5th-9th century, pre-Islamic Kashmir. 

Durga slaying Mahisashura seems a popular theme from Bengal. Shiva as Mrityunjaya is also intriguing and Surya, the sun god, is a rare depiction. 

Lot of art from 10th century Chola period – Vishnu, Hanuman, Shiva, Parvati and Skanda, Vishnu as chakra-purusha, Shiva Dakshinamurti – the lord who faces south, Nataraj, Shiva revealed in the linga, Shiva tripuravijaya – vanquisher of the three cities of demons. 

A standing Vishnu in Chera style from 10th century Kerala has a crown that is resplendent. 

Sometimes I feel like we are inside a temple. Indeed most of this art was probably taken from temples. Looted is a better word. Are Western museums glorified *chor bazaars* when it comes to oriental art?

We move into ancient Indonesia which also seems to have a lot of Indic influence. Slim faced Ganesha from 9th century, Buddhas, Krishna on Garuda from 9th century Java, 11 headed Avalokiteshwara Buddha from Thailand, Vishnu resting on serpent and a Brahma from Cambodia stand out. 

On the way out, I notice Egyptian murals with non-hieroglyphic lettering and find this novel. They look like a cross between Urdu and Chinese script. 

Shonu has been making noises about being tired. It is 2:15 and past lunch time. There is only so much art that can be taken in on one day, so we exit and call an Uber for Saravana Bhavan 15 minutes away. 

They have tables outside on the pavement, European style. Shonu gets vada and cheese dosa, Kamu gets milakai podi dosa and I get idli and Mysore masala dosa. Everything is delicious, including the sambar and chutneys. 

We take the 1 downtown train back to hotel. 

After afternoon nap, we walk to Grand Central Station. It is a cavernous, opulent, old world station that has featured in many movies.

Turn in by 10. Tomorrow is match day and we have to leave by 7. 

#### Day 5: 12th June 2024:


Match day today. Don't sleep well. Wake up at 5:30am, get ready and go down for breakfast by 7. Muffin, oatmeal, cereal, tea, coffee. Out by 7:20 heading to take downtown 1 train. 

Ride it to Penn station from where we have to take another line – LIRR, the Long Island Rail Road. We have bought tickets online using MTA app. There is different pricing for peak vs off peak. This is considered off peak since we're going away from the city. 

At the LIRR terminal, we start seeing people in India blue t-shirts. I ask one guy, a Gujju from Pennsylvania, which station the train will come on. He doesn't know but is watching a screen that has the train info. When the platform number 21 flashes on the screen, the desi fans in blue t-shirts make a run for it and we follow them. We manage to get seats but not everyone is so lucky. 

There is a desi and an American in the seat ahead of us each with their national flags. The train is full of blue shirts. The regulars must be wondering what the hell happened. One of the desis asks the ticket checker if this is considered off peak. Definitely not. 

![Ind vs USA](../../../img/ind-vs-usa.jpg)
<span class="credit">Ind vs USA</span>

Reach Westbury at around 9. The blue shirt crowd exits and we head to shuttle buses arranged by Nassau County to ferry us to the stadium. There is police stationed at regular intervals and we see lots of blue shirts walking and Indian flags. The arrangements by the local authorities are excellent and they are all in good spirits. 

There is a huge crowd outside the stadium. There are vendors selling t-shirts and hats. India T-shirt is selling for $120 which is unbelievably ridiculous markup. We decide to not buy but get a USA and India cap for $45 each, which is also daylight robbery. 

Entering the stadium and viewing the pristine turf is an incredible experience. We have seats that are to the left of the straight section at about a 30 degree angle from sight screen. We are in row 2, very close to the boundary. 

There is a Tamil group next to us from Philadelphia. The Indian team is on the ground practicing. I can spot Rishabh Pant, Kohli, Shivam Dube, Siraj, Bumrah, Suryakumar Yadav. To see them live in front of my eyes after only seeing them on TV is like watching Saturn through the telescope for the first time. They do exist. It is not all a fabrication. The amazing thing is that their mannerisms and movements are distinctive enough to make them instantly recognizable from a long distance. 

Ravi Shastri hosts the toss in his trademark bombastic style. India wins the toss and elects to bowl. 

A line of kids holding a massive wrapped Indian flag emerges from beneath us. From another side, a similar retinue of kids holding a US flag troops out. They line up in the center and unfurl the flag to dramatic music. The players line up. This is followed by the national anthems of India and USA. A stadium full of people singing *Jana Gana Mana* is an unusually emotional experience. The US anthem is sung well by some famous singer we don't recognize. 

The men in blue take the field led by Rohit.

A Gujju group has come in front of us. They are standing up most of the time blocking our view. Irritating. Luckily, it transpires that the seats aren't theirs when a couple of US supporters land up. These guys are more considerate and stay seated. In general the desis are giving the security a hard time by not sitting in their own seats. The security has to evict the Tamilians as well from the seats in front of us and some more Gujjus from the seats behind us. Desi jugaad alive and well in America. 

Arshdeep opens the bowling and I turn on my phone to record video. Amazingly, he takes a wicket with the first ball. It seems like he was bowled from the way Arshdeep runs off but it transpires that it was actually lbw that was really plumb. We have a three quarters view – but we get a good idea of the speed of the bowling. It seems pretty quick. 

Another wicket falls in the first over – a skied top edge taken by Pandya. 

It looks like a no contest. The US fans in front of us – who seem like US born Asians, probably Pakistanis – are distraught. 

The fans next to us are in high spirits. Arshdeep comes to the boundary near us after his over and we all shout his name and wave and he waves back. This immersive feeling can't be had watching from TV. 

Bumrah comes on in the 5th over. His run up is ridiculously short. How he generates such speed from it is hard to see but he is very quick. Pandya is generating disconcerting bounce. Another wicket falls in the 7th over – Gous skies one up off Pandya and Siraj who is fielding close to us and whom we all shouted and waved at moments before, runs up and takes the catch. 

They are playing music between deliveries which I find ridiculous and distracting. There is incessant high energy music blaring – Bollywood, English pop and rock, even Tamil. How the players are concentrating amidst all this din is a mystery. 

The Americans in front of us get French fries and the wafting fragrance makes Kamini wander off in search of food. 

Meanwhile, Nitish Kumar and Taylor are going great guns hitting sixes and fours and getting the US score towards a semblance of respectability. They have scored 45 runs in about 4-5 overs after being 50 in the 11th over. Wickets are also being lost. Axar Patel bowling from the far end gets Steven Taylor bowled. The stumps lighting up is very visible even from this distance. Milestones like team 50 and 100 are raucously cheered. 

Nitish pulls a short ball and it seems like it has gone for a six, but the Indians are running towards the fielder. It looks like a great catch has been taken. Siraj has pulled off a blinder. 81-5. There are two big screens which are showing the score and replays, so we get a different perspective on the action. 

By this time, Kamini is back with masala fries and a pretzel. Masala fries are French fries topped with a spicy and tangy tomato masala based gravy. Good stuff although messy. Pretzel is for Shonu since we don't know if the masala is safe for Shonu. 

Corey Anderson and Harmeet find the boundary a couple of times. By the 15th over they are 95 and it seems like they might score 120-130. 

But then the Indian bowlers put a squeeze on things and the US only end up getting 110. Siraj gets a run out off the last ball and it is obviously out even from this distance. Yet the umpire asks for the review and confirms. It seems like a low score, but given the difficult wicket, it should be a good contest. 

Rohit and Kohli walk out after the break to loud cheers. The love for the Indian players and these two in particular is off the charts. Kohli coming towards the boundary near us while fielding elicits the loudest cheers.  

But Kohli doesn't hang around to return this love. He is out to his first ball, the 2nd of the innings, caught behind off Netravalkar, who looks very sharp. The replay shows that it was a good ball but an extravagant shot. The crowd is stunned. We have seen so many blue shirts with Virat on them, and it must be a gut punch to them. 

Yet there are blue shirts who are also cheering for the US. It is remarkable, but there is zero animosity towards the US. Probably the fact that most of the crowd are also US citizens and permanent residents is a factor. And the high Indian content of the team and their win over Pakistan must also count. 

There is another jolt in the 3rd over when Rohit spoons one up off Netravalkar and Harmeet takes a good running catch. The wicket seems to have played a role in this one 
the ball looked to have stopped on him. This is a disaster. 10-2. Are we witnessing an upset? Netravalkar looks unplayable. 

Pant has walked out at number 3 and his talent and quality is apparent even from this distance. He is solid in defense, judging singles well and his boundaries are thrilling to watch. It seems like he is deliberately teasing the fielders by hitting the ball aerially in the gaps for boundaries. It is heart stopping to watch and every time he hits an aerial ball, we fear it will be caught. It must require not only extreme skill and strong sinews but also nerves of steel for these players to do this day in and day out with such a high rate of success. We are privileged to be watching elite athletes do their job. 

Suryakumar Yadav has replaced Rohit. He is struggling with timing and both him and Pant have switched tactics to take singles which they are doing quite well. 

Pant hits an outrageous flick pull for six off Jesse Singh who looks pretty quick. The ease of the shot is impressive. A partnership seems to be building. 

Ali Khan returns in the 7th over. A wave is going around the ground. Just when I think that this must be terribly distracting for the batsman, he produces a shooter that knocks Pant's middle stump over. 39-3. Trouble. Nothing Pant could have done about that one, wave or no wave. This isn't going to be an easy chase if someone of Pant's caliber can't handle it. 

Shivam Dube is next man in. The Tamilians next to us are calling him "Aaru sami" – six God. They are CSK fans and at times raise CSK chants. I wonder if Dube understands this nickname they have given him. One guy from the back is telling Dube that this is blue not yellow and to play properly. 

The atmosphere is tense for most of the game and it seems the result could go either way. The bowling is tight. Dube is struggling to even get singles and Suryakumar is not connecting his shots and confined to taking singles. The run rate is creeping up. Anything more than a run a ball seems hard. 

At one point, SKY slices a ball towards fine leg towards the far side from us. We fear the worst as Netravalkar runs backwards and gets into position to take the catch but then floors it. A decisive moment and probably a turning point of the match. There is much cheering and relief. 

There is the occasional boundary and six from both which keeps hopes up but the equation is still tight – 55 runs from 45 balls, then 35 off 30. An exciting finish is on the cards. At this point there is an announcement that India has been awarded 5 penalty runs for delay in between overs from US. The equation is now 30 off 30, run a ball. This is a gut punch to the US and the balance which was on a knife's edge throughout has decisively swung towards one side. We feel like it was unfair and that India didn't need to win like this. Whoever made this idiotic rule, it needs to be changed. People don't mind staying 5 extra minutes but the contest shouldn't be tampered with like this. 

Through all this tension, the crowd has been chanting *Bharat Mata ki Jai, Vande Mataram, Ganpati Bappa Moriya, Jeetega bhai jeetega*. 

Suryakumar now breaks the shackles and a flicked six and a four off van Schalkwyck make the result a formality. 

SKY gets to his 50, a well deserved one, in the 19th over to loud cheers and Dube finishes off the game with a couple of runs from a straight drive. The Americans in front of us have left at the start of the 19th over. 

There is a lot of shouting and jumping and the players are shaking hands. We stay for Shastri's interview with Arshdeep and then make our way out with the teeming masses. The buses are packed and there is only standing room. At the station we have to make a run for the train which leaves in 2 minutes, when there is a ticket check and we desperately fumble with our phone to activate the tickets. Luckily we are just in time for the train and even get seats. The return train is an express and we reach much faster. 

We watch highlights in the evening. It feels like a different game – disembodied. The sense of immersion, excitement, energy and camaraderie we felt at the stadium is entirely absent even though we get a better sense of the cricketing action through the front on cameras. 

#### Day 6: 13th June 2024:


Wake up late today at 9, brush and go down for breakfast. On our way down, the elevator which is half full, stops at a floor. A middle aged man and woman have a large baggage cart that they try to push in. It is obvious it won't fit. The woman insists that they have to get in anyway and tries to barge it in. The man refuses and says he won't do it and walks away to the side in a huff. The door closes and we go down. Interesting bit of theater. A tiny slice of somebody's life. They are probably running late for a flight or have waited a long time for the elevator. 

Leave by noon for Flushing Meadows Corona Park in Queens. Queens is a borough of New York City, an administrative unit. Shonu says she wants to see it because Spiderman is from there. Get there by the 7 train. An elderly gentleman sitting next to me asks me how to get to Richmond Hill. I look up on Google maps and tell him to take Sutphin Blvd stop and then transfer to another train. He appears to be Bangladeshi and knows very little English. Not sure how much he understood. Our stop arrives before his and we have to get off. Feel bad for him and hope he gets to his destination. 

Queens is full of apartment buildings but these are not very tall. It has an open, suburban feel to it. We walk 15 minutes to Corona Park. When we reach it, we realize we are a long way from the park center which is where everything is. Take a Lyft there, passing through lots of apartment buildings and a few individual houses on the way. There is a gigantic globe called the Unisphere at the park center which was built for a trade fair. There is the Arthur Ashe tennis stadium where the US open is played. Unfortunately it appears closed. We don't have any appetite for a museum or a zoo which are in the park. In fact the whole park feels devoid of energy. Today's trip has been a dud. It is nearly 2pm and we are hungry so we return home on the 7 train, and combine the soup, and chipotle burrito we have into a meal. We also get a tofu, rice and veggie bowl from a place right next to the hotel which we save for dinner. 

Take a nap and walk to Lyric theater for Harry Potter and the Cursed Child Broadway play starting at 7. It is a 3.5 hour play. The theater is old world and has beautiful carpeting and dim lighting. Our seats are in the 3rd row, very close to the stage. 

Before the show starts, an announcer informs us that in seat service is available. Shonu makes Mom buy butter beer and also tries to make a pitch for popcorn, which is denied.

Only Shonu knows the context and story of this play, having read the screenplay thrice. However, the special effects are mind blowing and the acting is high class. The story is about Harry Potter's child Elvis Potter who travels through time to prevent a death. I hadn't expected the effects to be so slick, that too from so close to the stage. The combination of the effects and the class of the actors creates a highly convincing illusion. We are engrossed for the entire 3.5 hours. At times the effects transcend the stage and enter the audience space. The scene near the interval where Voldemort's ghostly apparitions swirl high above the stage and over the audience is particularly chilling. All the actors are brilliant. The transitions between scenes are pin point and done without missing a beat. The lighting and music are instrumental towards creating an aura of believability. Full *paisa vasool*. 

Play ends at 10:30pm. Walk back through Times Square. Insane energy and bustle. No place like New York City in the whole world. Nothing comes close to this level of energy. Not European cities. Not Hong Kong. Not Singapore. Times Square is permanently on Red Bull. Makes Santa Monica 3rd street seem like a quaint village. 

#### Day 7: 14th June 2024:


We decide to go to Columbia University where Kamini is doing CEO program. Unfortunately, the university is closed to the public probably due to the recent Gaza protests and she never applied for campus access. The campus itself is right in the middle of the city similar to UCLA. We walk around, find a shady area with benches and relax for some time before heading back to 24th street for lunch at Junoon, MasterChef Vikas Khanna's Michelin star restaurant. 

The ambience is elegant but not over the top. We order beverages. I take saffron delight, Shonu takes cilantro and Mom takes Mint drink. My drink had orange, mango and saffron notes. Refreshing. The others drinks are also refreshing I gather. 

It is a 3 course lunch. We get to each pick one item per course which they will bring out one course at a time. Starters: I have kurkure bhindi, Shonu has lasooni gobi, Mom has baingan chaat. We share. Baingan chaat is eggplant slices ka bhajiya with light spice. Lasooni gobi is soft and has subtle hints of garlic. Kurkure bhindi consists of thin crispy slices of bhindi well fried and accompanied by a sweetish and savory tomato based sauce.

For the main course: me and Shonu have achari paneer, and Mom has Nadru kofta, made from lotus root with a gravy. All well presented and delicately yet distinctively spiced. The paneer is freshly made and soft, the achari gravy mildly spicy and sour. The kofta is soft and mildly savory with some sweet notes. The naan has egg so we get roti and hara bhara paratha. Both are freshly made and soft with a hint of crispiness. 

Desserts: I have maa ki kheer, a creamy textured, slightly sweet and rich rice pudding with caramelized almonds and banana. Shonu has kulfi – four flavors on sticks presented in a beautiful decorated wooden stand, each shaped differently. The flavors are mango, rose, saffron and ube malai. It is creamy, stretchy and soft per Shonu. Mom has sorbet sampler – mango, coconut and guava, which melts in the mouth. 

Overall, the meal is very well conceived and executed although it caters to a Western palate in terms of spice levels. 4.8 stars. 

#### Day 8: 15th June 2024:


Back to pavilion today. Check out from hotel at 11 after light breakfast downstairs. Kamini has charted a route to airport via subway. Shonu wants to take Uber but is overruled. Walk to 50th st and 8th ave metro station. Have to wait 15 minutes for A line to Queens Howard Beach stop from where we have to take Air train to terminal 8. In the F train, Shonu sulks and a girl sitting opposite understands and smiles. 

At the terminal, go through security which is slow. There is a family with 3 kids ahead of us who are very disorganized. The dad seems to be a desi. Kamini gets annoyed and says in Tamil that they should not get a big stroller at which the guy turns back with an understanding look. He might be a Tamilian. Oops. 

A moderately long walk to gate 1. It is 11:45. Flight is at 3:30. We walk back in search of lunch. Find a Villa Pizza place manned by desis. Get a cheese pizza and a penne pasta and share it. It is fairly Ok. KitKat for dessert. Back to gate. 

Flight taxis for a long time before take off. Mild bumps occasionally. They serve the same cheese and crackers box as on the flight to NYC which we stow away for later use. 

Watch an architecture video series on the in-house entertainment. Read a bit on phone. We land at around 6pm. Weather is sunny and 70 degrees. 

Take Lyft back home. Friendly driver. LA feels laid back in comparison to NYC. And very open and flat. We really loved NYC. The insane energy of the place, how much there is to do and how easy it was to get around. It is like a European city in terms of public transport. Didn't really come across the rudeness that NYC is known for. Maybe this side comes out more during the grim winters. 

Notice smoke in the air as we approach Simi Valley. Fire on I-5 at Gorman.

Reach home at 7.
