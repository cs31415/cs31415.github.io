### Arizona New Mexico Diary


#### Day 1: 22nd November 2025:

Woke up at 7am. Windy and overcast. Mini uthappams and apple for breakfast. Leave by 9:30. George, Goldie and Motilal tag along. Brownie also who lives in the car. Moderate traffic. Maps routing through I-5 and 134 East. Listening to Shonu's Arijit playlist of sappy romantic songs. It is short so switch to Life Kit podcasts. How to Declutter, how to negotiate (BATNA), how to improve posture. Coffee at 11:30. Hit traffic after getting on I-10. Lets up after Palm Springs. Some truck traffic slowing us down as they overtake each other. Roads improve as we enter Arizona. 

Halt briefly at 2pm for Subway at Blythe. Shonu has footlong on Italian herbs and cheese. We share a footlong on wheat bread. 

Back on the road. This is the smoothest stretch of road so far and we make good progress. Rahman playlist raises energy levels. Reach Phoenix by 5:30. It has started raining. Drizzling turns to lashing rain. Stop to refuel at Circle K. Have another coffee and back on. Now the rain is coming down with the wrath of God. Turn on blinkers and drive at 55-60. A brief respite from time to time but it picks back up as we approach Tucson. Indra and Zeus are engaged in titanic battle as lightning bolts light up the sky. It is cascading down so hard that I can't even see the lane markers. We make it through and reach at around 8pm local time which is 1 hour ahead of Pacific time. We are staying in Marriot Springhill suites. Room 214. Nice spacious room with sofa, writing desk and walk-in closet. Shonu has brought laptop and we watch India vs SA test match. Indians looking insipid and flat as Muthusamy and Vereynne dig their heels in. Pumpkin and squash curry patty dahi chaat for dinner. Delicious. Shonu has nachos with queso and I have a cheese tortilla. Shonu goes down to the lobby to get a cold drink. 

Hit the bed like a sack of bricks at 10:30.  

#### Day 2: 23rd November 2025:

Woke up at 7:15. Rain had stopped but still some clouds. Aunty got ready first followed by me and then Shonu. Packed and trudged down for breakfast. Kept some luggage in car. Shonu was making waffles when I got back and I made some too. They were surprisingly good. Oatmeal was also very good. Muffin was ok. Coffee with vanilla creamer was icing on the cake. Breakfast area was not that busy. 

Checked out and headed to car. Aunty realized that Motilal had been left behind. Shonu was the culprit. Went back and sheepishly requested a key. By then these two had gone upstairs and retrieved Motilal using a key from the cleaning staff. A close shave for Motilal. Could have been left high and dry in Tucson. 

Filled gas at circle K and headed for Chiricahua National Monument roughly midway between Tucson and Las Cruces. We had to pass through Wilcox, AZ, which looked like a ghost town. Nobody around and just a few cars parked. Some houses looked abandoned. Looks like a town in decline. 

It was a further 30-40 minutes to the visitor center through a vast wilderness. There was nothing for miles on all sides. Some of the landscape reminded us of Joshua Tree and some of Zion and Bryce. 

Turns out that the park was free. Drove up long winding road to Massai point. Along the way, there were pinnacles on both sides of the road, finger like formations in red rock with some precariously balanced ones on top. Apparently, there was a magma chamber nearby which erupted 27 million years ago depositing a layer of ash and molten rock which slowly compressed, fused together and cooled to form rock known as rhyolite. Erosion stripped away the softer layers to expose the pinnacles and digit like formations and the hanging rocks. 

It started raining as soon as we got out of the car at the top. Went back to wear shoes and get winter caps. 

There was a stairway with large stone steps leading down to a trail. There was a panoramic view where we took a couple of photographs. There was a one mile hike ahead. It started to rain with small hail pellets and it became freezing cold. The hike was abandoned and we returned to the car. Went back down and up to another winding road up to Sugarloaf mountain. Some lovely views from here too of cloud covered summits. 

Came back down and stopped at a pullout for some pictures of a formation known as the organ pipe. Had a lunch in the car there of cucumber cheese and chips sandwich, chips and queso. Cadbury dairy milk for dessert. 

Then back on the road. As we entered New Mexico, the landscape became more open and we could literally see for 100 miles in all directions. The setting sun on the mountains in the far distance made for some panoramic views. We felt like we were in a really remote place, far removed from civilization. The setting sun streaked the mountains and the sky in shades of magenta and blue. As darkness descended, the drive became more monotonous. After what seemed like a very long time through wilderness, dazzling lights of civilization resurfaced at Las Cruces like an oasis in a desert. 

Checked into the Springhill Suites which was not as polished as the one we had left in Tucson. But it was clean and had all the amenities. Briefly chatted with Appa about the trip so far. Had Annie's Mac and cheese, watched remainder of [Jolly LLB 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jolly_LLB_3) which we had started watching back home. The theme was individual rights and how the state violates them in the name  of the greater good but businessmen were painted as the villains with a broad brush as is the norm in most movies. Not much room for nuance here. A fine cast of assembled actors but the direction and plot failed to do them justice. 

#### Day 3: 24th November 2025:

![White Sands National Park](../../../img/white-sands.jpg)
<span class="credit">White Sands National Park</span>

Woke up at 8 after snoozing alarm multiple times. Went for breakfast after brushing since it was only up to 9. No waffles to Shonu's disappointment. Cinnamon raisin bagel with butter and cheese spread. They have oatmeal sachets and the condiments are more basic than in Tucson. Shonu has cinnamon toast crunch cereal without milk and tea. Coffee is alright. 

Back to the room to get ready. There is no hot water. The water heaters are broken and a technician is on the way. No ETA. An hour later, same status. I can't wait and take a cold shower. It isn't too bad after the initial shock has worn off. I take a small nap while these two get ready, also braving the cold shower. 

We get ready and leave by 12:30. Las Cruces is a smallish city with 100k population. A scenic backdrop of large mountains. A little run down but otherwise like any American city. Shonu is craving Taco Bell. Halt at one along the way to have a lunch of Mexican pizza, chalupa and potatoes. It is decent. We wonder what people do in this city. Google says medical, education, retail, aerospace and defense.  Los Alamos in New Mexico is after all known for the atom bomb which was developed there during WWII.  

Back on the road and heading towards White Sands National Park, about an hour away. Cross a New Mexico State University campus which is surprisingly large and modern and a Mormon church. 

Onto highway 70 leading towards our destination. The New Mexico landscape is vast and wide open with imposing mountains looming in the distance on all sides. Settlements are few and far between these vast swathes of open space. A NASA facility passes by, with a space shuttle model. We cross over a mountain pass to enter another vast basin with a striated mountain range in the far distance. After about 30-40 minutes, we sight white sands to our left. But first we have to pass through a US Border control checkpoint. The officer asks if we are citizens and lets us through. They must have scanned our license plate and got the same info. 

We have to take a left turn on the freeway to enter the park. The adobe styled visitor center is right there. We have to buy the pass at the park entrance a little ahead. There is a long line of cars. A few minutes later, we get a national parks pass for $80 and enter the park at around 3:15. The road winds upwards through the white sands, and becomes unpaved after some time, but not too rough. We pull into a large parking area to the left, and walk towards the dunes. The ranger at the visitor center advised picking a large dune with a view of the mountains for the sunset. We claim the first large dune we encounter and lay our towel on it. I go back to the car to bring coffee. I also bring a portable stool and tripod for phone. I tell Shonu to put her phone on the tripod in timelapse mode to capture the sunset. A few cursory photos are taken and we sit down to wait for the sunset. Shonu is recalling her calligraphy skills from elementary school on the sand. It is unusually warm though the temperate is only 61 degrees. 

Some kids on nearby dunes are attempting to slide down the dunes, but the sand is fine and sticky and they are getting stuck. This is gypsum sand, formed by wind erosion of gypsum crystals as opposed to the beige, silica dunes in Death Valley. A large, snow capped mountain is seen to the east. Peak Visor app on my phone tells me it is Mt Sierra Blanca, elevation of 11,981ft.  

Aunty has brought bhel puri materials and proceeds to make it right there on the dune – our version of *bhaji on the beach* (a British movie). She has also brought hot water for chai, but it has lost some edge. Shonu has chai anyway since she doesn't need it very hot. Bhel puri is welcome and rapidly consumed.  

Sunset brings a dramatic transformation to the landscape. The dunes turn bluish.  The mountain ranges in the far distance opposite the setting sun put on a dazzling light show, turning red, magenta and light blue as the sun dips below the mountains. It is kaleidoscopic. Some nice photographs are to be had, even some silhouettes. The temperature has dipped precipitously after sunset, and we don't dally as we return to the car. 

The drive back through twilight is scenic, as the distant skies run through a riotous gamut of colors – orange, red, magenta, blue, yellow – like Bollywood dancers' changing costumes in rapid succession.  

Back at the hotel, aunty inexplicably decides to take another bath since hot water has been restored. A dinner of lentil soup and quesadilla is had to the backdrop of some Netflix show about the inner lives of the Kapoor clan. Why this would be of interest is not clear to me. But it evidently is to many people. 

Shonu is sadistically watching India get steamrolled by SA while I write the travelogue.

#### Day 4: 25th November 2025:

![Guadalupe Mountains National Park](../../../img/guadalupe.jpg)
<span class="credit">Guadalupe Mountains National Park</span>

Woke up at 8 and went down for breakfast. Then got ready by 10. Water was still not hot but not as ice cold as yesterday. Checked out, filled up gas and air from circle K nearby and started on I-10 E and then on 62 E towards Guadalupe Mountains National Park. 

We soon enter Texas and pass through El Paso. Listening to Life Kit podcast on hair loss & power naps, then Rahman Tamil playlist on Shonu's request. Shonu remarks that Texas seems similar to Arizona. New Mexico seems more run down. I don't get a great impression about Texas. It seems rough around the edges. The freeway medians and shoulders are unkempt and unsightly. However, there are rest areas at regular intervals with picnic tables. The terrain is mountainous on one side and flat as a pancake on the other. Shonu says this terrain is called chaparral. We have some interesting discussions about how change in life situations can bring tendencies in people to the fore that were previously hidden. The discussion also veers to how the purported aim of religion is to help people lead better lives and to improve relations between people, yet it frequently acts as a divisive force leading to long lasting and murderous conflicts. We also discusss how one should be happy when one's friends do well, since the quality of our lives is proportional to the quality of our relationships.  

The mountains seem to be sedimentary rock with distinct striations visible. We enter a vast basin after passing through some mountain passes. At the far end of the basin are some large striated mountains that are much taller than flanking mountains. Given the general dullness of the landscape, there is a good chance this is the national park. We reach it in half an hour, after a drive through a canyon. Closer up, the mountains resemble Zion, but are not as red, more a grayish red. In fact, all the mountains in Texas are shades of gray. Surprisingly, the visitor center parking lot is full and we have make a couple of rounds to find a spot. It turns out that there are trails that start from the visitor center. 

There are 2 mile, 8 mile and 1/4 mile trails. We go with the 1/4 mile trail which conveniently starts from the visitor center. It is a paved trail and there are some good views of the rock faces. There are some strikingly shaped branches, trees and cacti. The trail leads to an abandoned post office. It is only 60 degrees but we are feeling hot. We were originally thinking of going on another trail, but drop the idea.

Back to the car and a lunch of cucumber, chips, cheese spread and queso sandwich, with tortilla chips and queso and Cadbury dairy milk for dessert. Then a one hour drive to the next destination, Carlsbad, New Mexico. There is also a Carlsbad in California, where I lived for a year in 2001-2. We pass Carlsbad Caverns, which is the main attraction in this place, on our way to the town of Carlsbad, which is 20 miles away. It is a completely rural town, and the caverns are the only reason this town is on the map. 

We are staying in a Fairfield Inn which is much nicer than the hotel we are coming from. Room number 324 on third floor. The room doesn't have a sofa or a kitchenette, but is otherwise well appointed. Me and Shonu have a power nap for 20 minutes while aunty takes a shower. We have Wagh Bakri chai with sev and biscuit, which is very welcome in this location. 

Haldiram kadhi chawal and rice for dinner followed by apple and chocolate. These two are watching Shark Tank and then play a game of identifying a person given some clues. I am typing this travelogue. 

#### Day 5: 26th November 2025:

![Carlsbad Caverns National Park](../../../img/carlsbad-caverns.jpg)
<span class="credit">Carlsbad Caverns National Park</span>

Woke up early at 6:45am. My phone is completely dead and alarm set for 6:30 didn't go off. Been having issues charging my phone off and on. Either its a bad charger cable or bad battery. We all get ready by 8:30, pack bags and head down. Put the luggage in the car and head for breakfast.

Desis have invaded the cafeteria. There is no other word for it. They have occupied most of the tables, and taken over the waffle station. Shonu wants waffle, but we tell her to eat other things for now and go back later for waffle. The desi kids are loud and unruly. Can tell that some of the Americans are flustered. Parents of desi boys don't make any effort to get their kids to behave. No American kids or other kids behave like this. Gives a bad name to Indians. Even though many of us are citizens and permanent residents, we are still ambassadors for our country of origin. 

We have a muffin, oatmeal and coffee. Shonu also has a muffin and yogurt. She goes back for waffle when the desi kids are done. One or two of them go back and queue up behind her. She shares a quarter piece with both of us. She has poured a strawberry comport over it which is disgustingly sweet and bright artifical red. This waffle isn't as good as the one we had in Tucson.

We check out after breakfast, fill gas at Shell station nearby and head to Carlsbad Caverns National Park. We have a timed entry at 10:30. A winding mountain road leads up to the park. Park at visitor center. Parking lot overlooks a panoramic vista of the flat, empty plains below extending in a semicircle from left to right. The vastness of the landscape is mesmerizing. So much empty land.

It is biting cold as we exit the car and head inside the visitor center. We have tickets but have to stand in line to get validated. The staff validates our ticket and hands us a green ticket to take to the checker. We are early and while away some time in the exhibit area where the history and geology of the park is covered. During the Permian period 270 million years ago, the present area was covered by a shallow inland sea, the Permian Sea, situated in Pangea, a supercontinent which split to form the present day continents.  The Permian Sea teemed with life, such as trilobites, ammonites and sponge and algae filled reefs. The reefs were uplifted by geological forces to create the Guadalupe mountains. The caves were carved out 12 to 2 million years ago (not 270 mya as I had mistakenly thought) by the action of carbonic acid and sulphuric acid dissolving limestone in the reefs. The stalactites, stalagmites and other formations known as speleothems were formed by carbonic acid seeping into the caves and depositing their dissolved limestone drop by drop. The caves were known to Native Americans but they were rediscovered and systematically explored by Jim White starting at the turn of the 20th century. 

At 10:30 we exit the visitor center and walk along a winding path towards the natural entrance to the caves. Batches of 10-15 visitors are being let in at a time for crowd control. A rather enthusiastic guide gives us some tips and information on dos and donts. No tripods, no talking loudly, no liquids and food other than drinking water, flash OK as long as it isn't disturbing others, kids to stay close to parents, it is a steep descent, etc. 

We descend down a serpentine paved path into the cave's large mouth. It looks like a bottomless pit, a hole punched into the earth. The descent is steep, but there are railings and the path has sufficient grip. We can see multiple telescoping levels as we descend. The caverns are dimly lit, with spotlights focused on interesting formations. The air inside is slightly humid and there are damp spots on the trail. There are some shallow pools at places. It is slightly warmer inside. The roof of the cavern is gigantic. It is 100s of feet high. It feels like we have entered an alternate universe, a world of perpetual darkness. The illuminated speleothems are eerily beautiful, like abstract art. Acidic water is the sculptor and limestone the raw material in this world.

We feel like the protagonists in Journey to the Center of the Earth, the book and the movie, as we descend into the bowels of the Earth. 

It is a mile long descent which takes us an hour and a half. There are several breathtaking formations along the way and many photo opportunities. Aunty is taking photos at every turn of the path. We pass others and are passed by others. Elderly people and families with small children are walking. At the end of it, we are at the bottom of the caverns, in an area known as Big Room. It is as big as a cricket stadium. A path winds around the edges, with formations on either side. Some of the formations in the center are ridiculously large, some as tall as a 3-4 story building. There are plenty of bell and temple shaped domes and what could be construed as Shivlings. We discuss that this would have been made into a temple in India, like Amarnath. Natural formations have divinity attributed to them. Pareidolia – the human tendency to spot patterns in nature. We also spot faces, figures with folded hands, a cheetah among other shapes. What seems to be the base of the cavern might just be one level. There are pits descending deeper still at places. One of them is called the bottomless pit 
it has a old wooden ladder dangling down it. The early explorers who descended into these unknown depths must have had hearts of steel. There are other collections of smaller formations called fairyland and dollhouse. After a point, it gets overwhelming. 

Amidst all this, the annoying desi kids have made a reappearance and are snapping at our heels. They are boisterous and their voices are echoing around the cavern despite the instructions to keep talk down to a whisper at the beginning of the tour. No other kids, including some other desi kids, are shouting like this. Shonu was tired earlier but getting away from these kids proves to be excellent motivation to quicken our pace. Soon we are at the end of the trail. 

Take elevator back up which takes us to the visitor center. The elevator shows feet covered instead of floors – we start from 800 and end at 0 – ground level. The same distance which took us an hour and half to traverse by foot takes 30 seconds. It is 1:45pm. 

There is a cafe at the visitor center. We have cheese pizza and quesadilla for lunch. Fairly decent. The counter clerk is cheerful and helps us identify foods with no allergens.

Exit and drive towards Alamogordo, a town where we will be spending the next 2 nights. Drive goes through Carlsbad town but we exit left before our hotel. Drive through rural areas with the chapparal land flat as far as the eye can see. Wonder if this soil is fertile and what the people living in the farms grow. The terrain goes from flat to wavy and winds upwards. A small truck with a trailer is ahead of me and the two lane highway doesn't have passing lanes. The truck and the wavy terrain and curving roads make it very hard to pass and I am forced to bide my time for quite a while. Finally, an open stretch presents itself, and I floor the pedal and manage to overtake to my relief. The terrain becomes alpine with trees and meadows. We drive through Cloudcroft, a quaint town similar to Big Bear in California. Bizzarely, there is snow on the ground on the slopes next to the road, but the road is clear. The temperature has now dropped into the 40s. The clouds, surrounding mountains and colors unleashed by the setting sun provide some breathtaking views. This seems to be the scenic drive we were supposed to do tomorrow. Some idiots want to speed even on this road, and one such truck does a risky maneuver to overtake me. The road is full of such idiots who will risk life and limb to reach 2 minutes early and drive well above speeds that the road can safely sustain.

Check into Hilton Home2 Suites in Alamogordo at dusk. The hotel is a little distance away from the main city. Our room is 203 on the 2nd floor right next to the elevator. Convenient. Well maintained and spic and span. Pop over to a Lowe's Signature Market grocery store in downtown to pick up soup, tortillas and cold drinks since stores will be closed for Thanksgiving tomorrow. The town appears to be quaint with adobe styled buildings, and a history museum. Unfortunately it will be closed tomorrow. 

Annie's pasta shells for dinner. Shonu watches [DDLJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilwale_Dulhania_Le_Jayenge) on Netflix on the TV. 

#### Day 6: 27th November 2025:

Rest day today. Chilling in the hotel after breakfast. 

Ching's Szechuan noodles for lunch. Taco with beans and rice for dinner. 

Saw two movies. [Humans in the Loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humans_in_the_Loop_(film)) about how tribal women in Jharkhand are training AI systems. A poignant movie with a deep message. AI is like a child. Its behavior depends on how we train it, what data we feed it. Native and tribal peoples are often marginalized in this process and their deep knowledge of and bonds with nature and the earth lost. [Sunny Sanskari ki Tulsi Kumari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunny_Sanskari_Ki_Tulsi_Kumari), a romcom about jilted lovers uniting to breakup their exes but ending up falling for each other. Good for a few laughs with a women's emancipation message thrown in as bonus. 

Filled 2025 Annual Review. 

#### Day 7: 28th November 2025:

Breakfast wasn't great. Waffle batter was watery, toaster didn't toast and oatmeal was dry. No bread either till staff were asked for it. Staff probably had Thanksgiving hangover. At least coffee was good so ended up drinking 2 cups. Check out by 10 and leave for Phoenix. Nice to have this break along the way in Alamogordo doing nothing. 

Pass through White Sands National Park from the opposite direction to our visit a couple of days ago from Las Cruces. Seemed busy. We could have gone a second time since we had the parks pass but decided it wasn't worth it. 

Also pass through Las Cruces. Listening to Amateur travel podcast about Yangtze River cruise. Interesting at first but then gets too much into the weeds. 

Listen to some horrible Tamil dance hits which are unbearable. Switch to an autogenerated Hindi language playlist which is slightly more bearable but still mediocre. Aunty makes reservations at 7pm at The Dhaba in Phoenix. 

The drive is through miles and miles of desert terrain – chaparral as far as the eye can see bookended by distant brown mountains. It is mostly flat and straight, so use cruise control to give feet a break. Services are sparse along this route. It is 1:30, lunch time, but nearest Taco Bell is 1 hour away. Shonu doesn't want to eat anywhere else. 

Stop for lunch at Taco Bell in Benson, Arizona at 2:30. It is clean and seems to be a new outlet. Me and Shonu have Mexican pizza topped by nacho fries, Aunty has chalupa topped with fries. It is pretty good. A middle aged man on the table behind us seems to be homeless although he looks decent. Possibly recently homeless. He is not ordering anything and moving very slowly. Have seen this with other homeless people too, perhaps due to lack of nutrition. Feel bad for him and would have given him money if he had asked. 

Back on the road. More robotic Arijit songs endured. Pass through Tucson. On our way in, we were driving in hellish weather. Now, it is bright and sunny. 

Arijit and other faceless mediocrities give way to Tim Ferriss podcast on simplifying your life. Interesting but hypocritical given all the gadgets and gizmos he keeps hawking. 

Pass through Chandler, Arizona with wide streets, neat pavements, cookie cutter housing colonies and apartments, but with no distinctive character. If someone was air dropped in the middle of this place, they would be hard pressed to say where they were. Many newer cities in California look equally mundane and insipid. 

Our hotel, Fairfield Inn, is in the nearby city of Tempe. The hotel is nicer than some others during our stay. Our room number is 233. These two take a nap while I tap this out on the phone. 

Head to The Dhaba nearby at 6:40. It is 5 minutes away. We chose this hotel precisely because it is close to Dhaba. We are here mainly to eat at Dhaba. In the immortal words of Kapil Dev (as played by Ranveer Singh in [83](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/83_(film))) ["What else we here for?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZki9HHjKo)

We order paneer tikka masala, tava sabji and garlic naan. Shonu orders mango lassi. We order another one to split between us. Fried papad appetizer is served with chutney. It is pretty good. Main course arrives shortly. Curries are flavorful. Only nitpick would be the color in paneer tikka masala. Naan is fresh and crisp. Saffron rice also seems to have some color. But we are hungry and Indian food is much welcome after a week of eating on the road. We order kadhi and saag to go so that we don't have to cook when we return. The manager is friendly and talks to us in Hindi which we like. They even give us complimentary  hot jalebi which is very fresh. Shonu's Dhaba craving has been satisfied. She has been wanting to eat here ever since this trip was planned. We were here last in November 2021 according to [my diary](https://chandrasivaraman.com/writings/Phoenix%20Diary/). Through a bizarre coincidence, we had ordered the exact same things last time, the only difference being that we ordered onion kulcha in addition to garlic naan. History repeats itself as they say. 

Watched [Ek Chatur Naar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ek_Chatur_Naar) on Netflix, a slick thriller about a street smart woman avenging her husband's killers using nothing but her brains.
