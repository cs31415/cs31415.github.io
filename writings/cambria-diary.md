#### Day 1: November 29 2024: Cambria

Day after Thanksgiving. Leave for Solvang around 9:30am. Accompanied by some little fellows – Jawa, Gullu, Muddles. Listening to different versions of *Mere dholna* – Shreya Ghoshal and Sonu Nigam versions ad nauseam, performed at a very high level of virtuosity. Take 154 scenic route. Some awesome panoramic views. But weak signal. Kamu is on phone with American Airlines to confirm UK tickets and the call cuts out on the hill top. I regret taking this route versus 101. Signal picks up as we near Solvang and I pull over into a shopping complex. Signal drops to zero here and call cuts out again. Drive back out onto the road and signal revives. Call is resumed and issue resolved – tickets confirmed, at least for now. Reach Solvang and search for parking. Find it on a quiet residential street off to the right side near Domino's pizza, on a bed of leaves.  

Cross street onto a little park with a bust of Hans Christian Andersen. Walk to Hans Christian Andersen museum. It is on the 1st floor. There is a book store which Shonu is eyeing. The museum isn't much to shout about. Models of the house he lived in, a bust, old copies of his books, cutlery etc. There are collections of his stories for purchase. Shonu says she has a copy and doesn't want to buy. There is a used bookstore as well on this floor. 

The bookstore downstairs is more interesting. Shonu finds some mystery/thriller fiction. Science section is not great. Kamini finds some gifts for anniversary – a journal, creativity sparker and Ansel Adams calendar. I find some interesting games. The purchases make a hole in our wallets. But at least the value is not instantly vaporized unlike food and will amortize over a longer time.

We are now hungry and head to Dolce's Cafe which has some vegan options. We find that it is run by a Lebanese family. Apparently celebrities like Arnold Schwarzenegger have graced this little hole in the wall, as photos on the walls inform us. Shonu gets a grilled cheese and tomato soup, I get a Beirut sandwich with Labneh and Zatar, fermented cousins of yogurt, Kamu gets a Mediterranean wrap. She gets a call back from American Airlines and eats while talking. They have messed up again and my seat is in basic cabin and non-refundable while theirs is in main cabin. She asks if we can upgrade me to main cabin and pay the difference of about $200. Shonu's sandwich and soup are good. Beirut sandwich is great. The wrap is decent. As usual Kamu eats half and asks for the remainder to be cut and packed. Shonu gets shaved ice. Pink lemonade flavor. 

We next visit a clock shop. There are scores of cuckoo clocks on the walls. A German Heidi clock makes a further dent in the wallet. But it is adorable. We buy raspberry and peppermint fudge from Old Danish Fudge kitchen. 

We walk around the town. Inquiries for vegan bread and pastries return condescending stares. The bread is for eating with the instant chola/palak paneer packets we have brought as insurance. 

Get coffee from Good Seed Coffee, a small local coffee shop. A heavenly aroma greets us as we enter. I get a cappucino which we split, Shonu gets hot macha latte. The cappucino has excellent flavor, one of the best I have had. 

We return to the car after the shopping and feeding frenzy and head to Cambria at around 2:30-3. It is a 2 hour drive. Some glorious ocean views en route. Brusque mountains morph into rolling hills and the setting sun paints the Morro Bay rocks in magenta hues. It is getting dark as we approach the main Cambria intersection. Our hotel is just to the left on Moonstone drive. It is a spa and hotel. Room is on 1st floor overlooking parking lot. It is spacious and updated. It doesn't overlook the ocean unlike the last place we stayed in but it makes no difference since we are only here for the night. 

We are hungry and go out in search of dinner to Main street, the town hub. A place called Harmony Cafe. I get a strong fish odor as soon as we enter. But these two are fine. We get a table. The menu has basically one vegetarian option and isn't cheap either. We make a quick exit. 

Drive on and find a pizza place – JBJ Roundup pizza. Order a large margherita pizza. Shonu wants fries as well. Turns out we bit a lot more than we could chew. The pizza is good but huge, is loaded with cheese and hits like a stone. We pack more than half of it. Return to hotel and hit the sack after playing a game we picked up from the bookstore – we have to pick a card with two options, then discuss which one we prefer and why. Would you rather have the ability to go without food or go without sleep, etc. Entertaining. 
  
#### Day 2: November 30 2024: San Simeon, Cambria, Morro Bay

I wake up at 7:30. Get ready and get some coffee and bagels from cafeteria. Coffee is good. Bagel is bland. Kamini gets ready and we head to cafeteria while Shonu is getting ready. Toast bagels and have yogurt and 2nd round of coffee. Take yogurt and toast a bagel for Shonu. 

Checkout and leave for Hearst Castle in San Simeon. It is a short 10 minute drive along highway 1. Park and wear shoes. Meanwhile these two have gone ahead to book tickets. By the time I reach the counter they have already booked tickets for 10:10 grand rooms tour. 

A photographer clicks the mandatory family photo before we get on the bus. I think she clicked while we were not even in position. The castle is situated on a hilltop. It was built by newspaper baron William Randolph Hearst between 1919 and 1947 – between WWI and Indian independence. The architect was Julia Morgan, a most interesting and feisty character in her own right in a time when female emancipation was not fashionable. 

Sweeping and panoramic ocean views greet us at every turn as the bus winds its way up the serpentine road. The Earth's curvature is very evident from this height. Haven't the flat earth believers ever climbed a hill with ocean views? We spot mountain goats along the path. The castle gradually emerges into view, behind a wall of trees. 

Hearst owned an actual castle in Wales and wanted a "little place" on the hilltop where he often hiked and camped as a child. 

The tour is led by a guide, a former school teacher. There is a minder at the back of the group making sure we don't wander off. We are told that the castle is an art museum and that we are to only walk on the grey carpet and not touch anything. 

We enter a large patio overlooking the ocean. There are a couple of lovely cast iron sculptures of a discus thrower and an angel holding a plate. 

We climb the stairs to the Neptune pool, a massive Roman style swimming pool with colonnades and a multitude of statues. 

From here another flight of stairs takes us to a patio overlooking the pool. There is a sculpture of the Egyptian goddess Sekhmet, with the head of a lion – the destroyer of life – on the body of a woman, the creator of life. The statues are carved from a dark granite (diorite). 

Then we are shown the facade to the castle, which is a composite of pieces of art from all over the world. We enter through a doorway into the assembly room, which is a massive old world space with sofa chairs, massive murals on the walls, walnut paneling on the ceiling, wrap around choir seating. This is where Hearst used to entertain guests in the evening. Edwin Hubble was one of the distinguished guests. 

Then we are led to a dining room which allegedly inspired Hogwarts dining hall in the Harry Potter movie. Hearst sat in the middle so that he could be closer to more guests and have conversations. From here to a billiards room, then a breakfast room, then the Roman pool, an indoor pool with gilded tiles underneath. This marks the end of the tour. We board the bus to return to the visitor center. 

Have chips in the car. Kamu is hungry and has the leftover wrap from yesterday.

We drive to the seal viewing area 4 miles away against objections from Shonu. A strong fish odor greets us as we step out of the car. Kamu feels nauseous and Shonu has to pat her back to settle her. We spot some massive elephant seals lolling around doing absolutely nothing, living the good life. But the smell is too much and we rush back to the car.

Fill up gas back in Cambria town and drive on. Morro Rock looms in the distance, inviting us to take a closer look. We take a detour into the town. It is an astonishing natural feature and feels overpoweringly large as you get closer to it. An enormous hill right on the beach. We wonder how it didn't get broken down by the ocean waves. Perplexity tells us it is a 23 million year old volcanic plug formed from an extinct volcano. Composed primarily of dacite, an igneous volcanic rock resistant to erosion. Some grumbling photos later we get back on the road.

A Taco Bell beckons in San Luis Obispo around the time we feel hungry at 2 o clock. Some Mexican pizza, chalupa and nacho fries are savored. This location seems newer and the quality hasn't gone to the dogs unlike other locations.  

Smooth drive. Make a pit stop for Starbucks coffee in Buellton. Me and Kamu share peppermint mocha. Shonu takes iced peppermint mocha. Some traffic as we near Camarillo skirted by taking highway 34. 

Thair sadam for dinner watching Kapil Sharma – Govinda, Chunky Pandey and Shakti Kapoor. Though we were gone only for a day and a half, it nevertheless felt like we had returned home after a while. Travel distorts our perception of time.
