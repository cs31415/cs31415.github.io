### Space Travelers

We are all travelers whether we like it or not.

The Earth rotates around its axis at 25K miles/24 = 1000 mph and screams around the Sun at 2 x pi x 93M miles/(365 x 24) = 1.6M miles/day = 66K miles/hour, while the Sun itself sears around the core of the Milky Way galaxy at = 5.85B/(365 x 24) miles/hour = 667K mph.

In other words, the earth rotates around itself at 1/66th the speed at which it moves around the sun which itself is a 10th of the speed at which the sun moves around the galactic core, which is 1/2000th the speed at which the galaxy itself is hurtling through space at the spine-chilling speed of 1.3M miles/hour (measured by using cosmic background radiation as a frame of reference and measuring it’s red shift).

Even the most armchair-ridden among us are streaking through space at 1.3M mph!(Absurdly fast though this may seem, this is still only 0.2% of the speed of light which is 670M mph!) And remember this is all still relative to our own universe, which for all we know may be warping through other space-times at galaxy knows what speeds.

How can it be that we don’t feel it? Why don’t we feel the million mph space wind in our hair? Flip that around. What does 1.3M mph feel like? It feels like whatever you are feeling right now!

I think the reason we don’t feel it is that there aren’t enough objects in our proximate neighborhood to provide us with a sensation of motion, because space is mostly empty, which is good for us! Less probability of planet-annihilating collisions. The objects we are moving away from at high speeds – stars and galaxies – are all too far away from us to perceive motion. The Sun and Moon are the closest objects in our backyard, and our speeds are so low we barely perceive our motion relative to them. As for the space wind or lack of it, I conjecture we can attribute that again to the space vacuum. Wind is caused by a pressure differential which technically cannot exist in a vacuum.

Compared to cosmic speeds, our fastest rockets(10K mph), superjets(NASA X-43 unmanned hypersonic jet – 4700 mph) and bullet trains(268mph – Shanghai Maglev) appear disgracefully slothful.

How can one rotate around the earth at such a speed as to remain at the same time of day, say 6 am, at all times?

The earth is longitudinally carved up into 24 divisions (1 day = 24 hours).
Distance between time zones = 360/24 = 15 degrees of longitude
At the equator, that equals a distance of (15/360) x 25K miles = 1000 miles

So to jump from one timezone to another, one has to traverse 1000 miles in an hour.i.e. One has to travel at the speed of 1000 mph opposite to the earth’s rotation. i.e. 1000mph east to west. The closer to the poles you go, the lesser the inter-longitudinal distance, and so the slower you can go. In fact at the poles, you don’t need to travel at all. You can just sit still and be in all the time zones at once.
