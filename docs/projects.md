A tool that applies a regular expression to a	 given text and displays the match output in a
structured format, including named captures, etc. and also highlighting them in the source text.
	
### SQL Parser
A tool that takes a list of stored procedure scripts and parses them to extract referenced
SQL entities such as tables, functions and stored procedures. It also flags dynamic SQL usage
for further investigation.
 		
### CSharp Parser
A tool that takes a directory containing C# files and parses them to extract SQL commands
such as stored procedure calls and inline SQL. This output can be further run through the above
mentioned SQL Parser to extract referenced SQL entities.
	
### Synonym search	
Efficiently search a body of text for synonyms (or antonyms) of a word
or a set of unrelated words using Aho-Corasick algorithm and task parallelism
	
### Expression engine
Provide the ability to define and evaluate an expression in C# at runtime
given a set of key-value pairs corresponding to variables used in the expression and their values 
	
### Table comparer
Given two tables with the same or equivalent data models, apply a mapping function
to convert one model into the other and perform a compare operation,
identifying differences in matched records, and orphan records. 
	
### Data structures & algorithms quick reference		
My implementations in Ruby of standard data structures and algorithms such as linked lists,
binary search, hash tables, BFS, DFS, etc.
	
### Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
Solutions to problems in the MIT text using a LISP dialect called Scheme.
	
### Misc
Puzzles, etc.
