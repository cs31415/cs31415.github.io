I'm a Software Engineer and Application Architect, Photographer, Writer, Traveler. I live in a Los Angeles suburb, enjoying the California sunshine and geography.

I have written software to sell movie tickets, automate home loan processing, provide electronic document marketplace for mortgage loans, sell mortgage backed securities on Wall Street, manage operations for hedge funds, CRM software for auto dealerships and automated testing tools for mainframe software. 

If I were to drop jargon, things like microservices, C#, Web API, MVC, nodeJS, MS SQL Server, AWS, Lambda, etc. would spill out. Some exotic skeletons like Algol might also tumble out. But I lay faith in more timeless things such as SOLID principles, Design patterns, functional/OO programming principles, test-driven development, consistent nomenclature, clean design, clean code etc.

I like building software [tools](/projects). I particularly enjoy the UI design aspect of this and learning about design principles.     

I like [photographing](https://www.instagram.com/cs31415) nature, urban scenery as an outlet for visual creativity, as a form of walking meditation, as an idea generator, sifter and sorter.  

I wrote a series of 16 short stories (in embarassingly florid prose) about a pair of maverick, prank-loving kids - a kind of Indian Tom Sawyer-Huck Finn. One a dreamer, the other a doer. They have a cheerful, optimistic outlook on life and strive to understand and improve the world in their own small, charming ways.  

I love to read. Fiction is unparalleled as AR/VR and an empathy building tool. If only HR departments were more empathetic, we'd be reading instead of numbing our minds with training. Mark Twain, Naipaul, Tolkien, Arthur Clarke, Asimov, Ayn Rand, Conrad, Doyle, Wells, Maugham, Tintin - I find worth rereading. In non-fiction, I have loved Carl Sagan, Dawkins, Steven Novella, Gould, Mihir Desai - topics ranging from cosmology to evolution to skepticism to natural history to finance.   

I'm a fan of [Test cricket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket), an increasingly unpopular, modern day anachronism. Played over a whole work week, it frequently oscillates between mind-numbing boredom and feral excitement. It demands grit, technical excellence, ability to analyze and adapt to different situations and deep reservoirs of character and stamina - qualities that translate well to real life.
