<b>Software Engineer</b>, <a href="/">writer</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cs31415">photographer</a>, traveler and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket">cricket</a> fanatic. I write about Software best practices and Computer Science topics, to crystallize and organize amorphous thoughts, and to pass on lessons learnt from mentors, books and painful experiences to others, taking to heart the words of <a href="https://paulgraham.com/words.html">Paul Graham</a> that "no one who hasn't written about a topic has fully formed ideas about it".
