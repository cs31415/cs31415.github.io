Math and Computers  
Could computers exist without math? To start with, the computer's vocabulary consists of binary numbers 0 and 1. Numbers are Math, albeit at a ridiculously rudimentary level.   
Transistors on tiny slivers of silicon switching on and off like fireflies in the night provide intimations of more complex things. They are doing Boolean arithmetic,  invented by the eponymous George Boole.  The Hardware only understands voltage levels, lower being 0 and higher being 1. A programmable chip, which is a meaningful collection of  transistors harnessed towards a worthy goal, such as an adder or a timer, deals with binary digits, or bits, at a higher level of abstraction. Such a chip may provide multiple commands, which are input as bit sequences, for example, 00 is add, 01 subtract and so on. These commands in turn operate on 0-n binary inputs, and produce a single binary output. Chips can thus be strung together to perform complex calculations. A computer's microprocessor is just such a chip, which has an instruction set which are the set of commands.
