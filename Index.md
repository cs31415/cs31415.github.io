Hi! I'm **Chandra**.  

I'm a **Senior Developer** and **Application Architect**. I was trained as an Electronics Engineer but fell in love with programming.       

My professional experience is mostly in **C#** and **.NET** with a sprinking of **JavaScript**. Personally, I'm a fan of functional languages like LISP and like Ruby's exquisite simplicity for adhoc tasks.

I've mostly worked on projects in **finance** and **entertainment**/movies. I get excited when I'm learning a new language or run into a new problem to solve.

I can add value around setting up a **microservices** stack for web apps, refactoring and modernizing existing stacks, championing process, clean design, coding & testing, automating repetitive/pattern-oriented tasks, and fixing thorny problems in general. 

I love building **tools**. I just wrote a couple of tools to parse C# and SQL code and list out referenced SQL objects. DBAs needed this for a cloud migration project and doing this manually would have been too time-consuming and error prone. I'm working on a personal knowledge management tool in my spare time. 

Feel free to contact me for anything!
