<p>Hi! I’m <strong>Chandra</strong>.</p>

<p>I’m a <strong>Senior Developer</strong> and <strong>Application Architect</strong>. I was trained as an Electronics Engineer but fell in love with programming.</p>

<p>My professional experience is mostly in <strong>C#</strong> and <strong>.NET</strong> with a sprinking of <strong>JavaScript</strong>. Personally, I’m a fan of functional languages like LISP and like Ruby’s exquisite simplicity for adhoc tasks.</p>

<p>I’ve mostly worked on projects in <strong>finance</strong> and <strong>entertainment</strong>/movies. I get excited when I’m learning a new language or run into a new problem to solve.</p>

<p>I can add value around setting up a <strong>microservices</strong> stack for web apps, refactoring and modernizing existing stacks, championing process, clean design, coding &amp; testing, automating repetitive/pattern-oriented tasks, and fixing thorny problems in general.</p>

<p>I love building <strong>tools</strong>. I just wrote a couple of tools to parse C# and SQL code and list out referenced SQL objects. DBAs needed this for a cloud migration project and doing this manually would have been too time-consuming and error prone. I’m working on a personal knowledge management tool in my spare time.</p>

<p>Feel free to contact me for anything!</p>
