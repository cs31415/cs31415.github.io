I'm a hobbyist [photographer](https://www.instagram.com/cs31415). Photography, for me, is a type of walking meditation that engages the intuitive side of the brain, the wellspring of ideas.

I wrote a series of 16 short stories about a pair of maverick, prank-loving kids named Ramu and Somu, a kind of Indian Tom Sawyer-Huck Finn, 
one a dreamer, the other a doer, living in the musty, nondescript town of Shivajinagar in the Indian 
hinterland. 
	

I am a keen armchair aficionado of that most timeless, inexhaustible-fount-of-drama, life-in-microcosm, modern day anachronism - the character-forging-foundry called [Test cricket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket), played over a whole work week  oscillating between mind-numbing boredom and feral excitement, whose frequently energy and nerve-sapping conclusion guarantees no ultimate winner.
