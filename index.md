I'm a **Software Engineer** and **Application Architect**. I was trained as an Electronics Engineer but fell in love with programming instead.

My experience is primarily in **C#** and **.NET**, with a couple of years in **nodeJS** and **AWS**. I like dabbling in programming languages and try to use functional programming principles learned from languages like **LISP** and **Ruby** in **C#** & **nodeJS** projects.

I have many years of experience designing and building solutions for **finance** and **entertainment** domains. I get excited when learning a new language or framework, designing a system or being flummoxed by a problem.

I've led design and implementation of **microservice** architectures, enhanced and refactored brownfield systems, evangelized automated testing, SOLID principles, consistent naming standards, and automated repetitive tasks among other things. 

I advocate building **tools** whenever feasible to automate manual work. I have automated P&L report generation, business rule extraction from code using regular expressions, extraction of SQL object references from code, searching text for multiple terms, synonyms/antonyms, etc. 

### Trivia:
[Photography](https://www.instagram.com/cs31415) is a side hobby. It is a walking meditation that often manifests ideas and solutions that elude focused effort.

I have tried my hand at writing fiction. I wrote a series of 16 short stories about a pair of maverick, prank-loving kids named Ramu and Somu. A kind of Indian Tom Sawyer-Huck Finn. One a dreamer, the other a doer; living in the musty, nondescript town of Shivajinagar in the Indian hinterland. They have a cheerful, optimistic outlook on life and strive to improve the world in their own small, charming ways.  

I am an armchair aficionado of [Test cricket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket), a timeless, modern day anachronism. Played over a whole work week, it frequently oscillates between mind-numbing boredom and feral excitement. It demands technical excellence and deep reservoirs of character and stamina, and is like a Shakespearean play in four acts where every raw human emotion is on display.
