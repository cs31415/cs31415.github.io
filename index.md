I'm a **Senior Developer** and **Application Architect**. I was trained as an Electronics Engineer but enjoyed programming more than any other subject.

My professional experience is mostly in **C#** and **.NET** with a sprinking of **JavaScript**. Personally, I'm a fan of functional languages like LISP and like Ruby's conciseness and ease for adhoc tasks.

I've mostly worked on projects in **finance** and **entertainment**/movies. I get excited when I'm learning a new language or encounter a new problem to solve.

I can add value around building **microservices** stacks for web apps, refactoring and modernizing existing stacks, championing process, clean design, coding & testing, automating repetitive/pattern-oriented tasks, and fixing thorny problems. 

I love building **tools**. I recently wrote a couple of tools to parse C# and SQL code and list out referenced SQL objects. DBAs needed this for a cloud migration project and doing this manually would have been too time-consuming and error prone. I'm working on a personal knowledge management tool in my spare time.
