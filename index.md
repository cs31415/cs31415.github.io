I'm a **Software Engineer** and **Application Architect**. I was trained as an Electronics Engineer but got mesmerized by programming pretty quickly.

I have 15+ years of OO experience with **C#** and **.NET**, and 3 years in **nodeJS**, **.NET Core** and **AWS**. In recent years, I have been captivated by functional programming techniques in LISP and have been using them in C# and JavaScript ever since. 

I have experience architecting and constructing a diversity of solutions in the **finance** and **entertainment** domains. I've led construction of **microservice** architectures for high traffic sites as well as high volume backoffice automation jobs. I enjoy refactoring and modernizing brownfield systems. I have championed SOLID principles, design patterns, consistent naming standards and test driven development in teams I have worked with. 

I advocate building **tools** whenever feasible to automate manual work. I have automated MBS pricing models for a mortgage banker, P&L generation for a hedge fund, code parsing to extract business rules for a mortgage banker, code parsing to extract SQL object references for AWS migration for a movie ticket retailer, among other projects. 

### Trivia:
[Photography](https://www.instagram.com/cs31415) is a hobby and a way to relax and unwind. 

I wrote a series of 16 short stories about a pair of maverick, prank-loving kids - a kind of Indian Tom Sawyer-Huck Finn. One a dreamer, the other a doer. They have a cheerful, optimistic outlook on life and strive to understand and improve the world in their own small, charming ways.  

I am an armchair aficionado of [Test cricket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket), a timeless, modern day anachronism. Played over a whole work week, it frequently oscillates between mind-numbing boredom and feral excitement. It demands grit, technical excellence, ability to analyze and adapt to different situations and deep reservoirs of character and stamina - attributes also useful for a career in programming.
