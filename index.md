I'm a **Senior Developer** and **Application Architect**. I was trained as an Electronics Engineer but fell in love with programming instead.

My professional experience is in **C#** and **.NET** with a sprinkling of **JavaScript**, **nodeJS** and **AWS**. I'm a fan of functional languages like LISP and like Ruby's conciseness and ease for adhoc tasks.

I have significant experience building solutions for **finance** and **entertainment** domains. I get excited when learning a new language, designing a system or encountering a new problem to solve.

I can contribute to building **microservice** stacks for web apps, refactoring and modernizing existing stacks, championing process, clean design, coding & testing, automating repetitive/pattern-oriented tasks, and fixing thorny problems. 

I relish building **tools** to automate manual work. I recently wrote a couple of tools to parse C# and SQL code and list out referenced SQL objects. DBAs needed this for a cloud migration project and doing this manually would have been too time-consuming and error prone.
