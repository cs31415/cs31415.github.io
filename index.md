I'm a **Software Engineer** and **Application Architect**. I was trained as an Electronics Engineer but fell in love with programming instead.

My experience is primarily in **C#** and **.NET** and more recently in **JavaScript**, **nodeJS** and **AWS**. I'm a fan of functional languages like LISP and like Ruby's conciseness and ease for adhoc tasks.

I have significant expertise building solutions for **finance** and **entertainment** domains. I get excited when learning a new language, designing a system or encountering a new problem to solve.

I've led design and implementation of **microservice** stacks for web apps, refactored and modernized existing stacks, championed process, clean design, coding & testing, automated repetitive/pattern-oriented tasks, and fixed thorny problems like 
improving reliability of asynchronous backend tasks and fixing runaway memory leaks requiring daily server reboots. 

I'm an advocate of building **tools** wherever feasible to automate manual work in my projects. I recently wrote a couple of tools to parse C# and SQL code and list out referenced SQL objects. DBAs needed this for a cloud migration project and doing this manually would have been too time-consuming and error prone.
